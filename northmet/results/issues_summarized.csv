Issue,Count,Summary
WAT,1001," The city of Biwabik, town of white and Aurora are planning a new city water system . When sulfur comes into contact with water and oxygen it becomes sulfuric acid . The St. Louis River, after decades and more than $100 million dollars spent on cleanup, is finally becoming a safe place to live, work and play again ."
GEN,846," I am 100% against this mining venture, and the land swap . It will profit the owners who do not even live here but can do much damage to our waters and land and air . There is no nickel mine in North America currently, meaning any conflict could leave North American civilization in dire straits . Anyone who believes this will not lead to a environmental nightmare has their head in the sand ."
SO,325, The long-term costs (potential and actual) to the State of MN are far greater than any projected economic gain . I don't think the benefits of jobs potentially provided by the mine outweigh the benefits . The mining companies are only interested in profit. They couldn't care less about the impact their mining practices have on our communities .
FIN,263," The environment will eventually be polluted by the NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange Project . Each of those mines passed a similar environmental impact statement process, then left unacceptable amounts of pollution to clean up, paid for mostly by taxpayers . Any leaking mine will come at the expense of Minnesota because we are left to deal with the contamination ."
PER,231," The state and federal standards proposed are more than adequate to protect the environment . The need for these resources is not so great, nor has it been proven as such, that it warrants issuing permits . No [Clean Water Act Section 404] permit should be issued for the proposed mine because it would degrade groundwater and surface water ."
NEPA,209," The proposed mines are simply not needed and prudent, conservative resource management dictates that the minerals should be left in the ground and extracted only if needed by future generations . Polymet estimates 275 million tons of reserves and 694 million ton of resources - a tiny fraction of what the U.S. Geological Survey estimates may be available ."
ALT,165," The PolyMet FEIS is adequate under federal and state laws and regulations . Minnesota does not currently need the potential economic support that could be realized by undertaking sulfide mining projects . The area is revered by thousands, if not millions, of people from all over the world ."
WET,149," The proposed mine would destroy nearly 1,000 acres of high-quality wetlands . More than 66 percent of Great Lakes’ original wetlands have been filled in or destroyed . Wetlands provide essential services for people such as reducing flooding, preventing erosion and improving water quality ."
PD,148," The proposed PolyMet NorthMet copper-nickel mine has the potential to spread toxic metals throughout our watershed . Water that passes through the site leaches toxic metals, including mercury, from the metallic sulfide ore . The FEIS claims PolyMet will treat contaminated water for as long as it takes to keep it from polluting the environment ."
MERC,132," PolyMet NorthMet SDEIS was inadequate to analyze mercury and methylmercury impacts at the project site and cumulatively, in the St. Louis River and Embarrass River watersheds . Blasting will cause mercury to become monatomic or shattered into single atoms into the atmosphere . Expert opinion of Dr. Brian Branfireun, one of the world’s leading mercury researchers, identified inadequacies ."
O,132," The decision whether or not to go forward with PolyMet and new mining on the Range is about process, not politics . Siguard Olsen: Health of Americans is being put at risk in hundreds of projects that introduce toxic substances into our wetlands and the air we breathe ."
MEPA,105, The PolyMet NorthMet sulfide mining proposal and the Final EIS is inadequate to guarantee environmental safety or long-term economic advantage . Itasca County Board of Commissioners declares its support for the adequacy of the final environmental impact statement . Mining in Minnesota would be cleaner and far more responsible than any jurisdiction in which I have operated .
HU,94, I'm very concerned that this sulfide mine would affect drinking water and fish . The health problems that come down from this mining will never get fixed . I would like you to analyze the cancer rates of populations around strip mining pits vs. the national averages . Doctors and nurses across Minnesota have asked for a comprehensive analysis of human health risks .
LAN,92," The U.S. Forest Service proposal to exchange Superior National Forest land for the PolyMet proposal should never happen . Dicing up the national forest, contaminating adjacent land and waters with poisonous sulfide will have serious ramifications down the decades . Lake County has approved or entered into an agreement or contract with PolyMet for the sale of lands to PolyMet ."
CUM,83," DNR chose not to examine the cumulative impacts of this scale of development on the Superior, they chose to ignore the elephant in the room . Hard, scientific facts have been ignored, including those related to health issues . I think the overall net loss of high quality vegetation, rare species and wildlife habitat and corridors is unacceptable ."
GT,78, PolyMet proposes storing billions of gallons of toxic mine waste behind a forty year old leaky dam . The public demanded to know how PolyMet would deal with such a failure . PolyMet simply asserts that the chances of such failure are too remote to even be considered in the EIS .
AIR,72," Minnesota’s gross emissions of GHGs grew by 32% between 1990 and 2005, twice the national average of 16% . PolyMet project will emit more than 10 tons of sulfuric acid . The FEIS (Table 5.7-1) is incomplete; it does not show the recently promulgated ozone standard of 0.070 ppm ."
WI,61," The PolyMet Sulfide Copper Metal Mine is set to be built near the St. Louis River and Lake Superior Watersheds . Many of the animals which use the waters for drinking, swimming, bathing and food will be affected from runoff and pollution from mine ."
CR,59," Sohm: ""You are not entitled to interfere with our usufructuary rights to hunt, fish and gather our foods and medicines"" The NorthMet mine site is ceded land under the 1854 Treaty Authority . Sulfates are harmful to plant species and native wild rice, economically important to the Ojibwe people of northern Minnesota . 1854 Ceded Territory Treaty needs to be honored ."
ROD,39, The USFS should reject the proposed exchange of Superior National Forest lands for the PolyMet project . The land exchange would be in direct opposition to long-standing federal policy that protects wetlands . The exchange would mean the destruction of 700 acres of imperiled Black Spruce – Jack Pine Woodland .
WILD,24," The analysis concludes that PolyMet’s treatment and mitigation plans will prevent acid mine drainage and will meet all water quality standards . Thousands of visitors to the Superior National Forest and BWCAW seek solace in the wilderness, as it is one of the last areas in our Nation that is protected from pollution ."
VEG,22," The Floating Marsh Marigold is listed as endangered in Wisconsin where there is only one known population . Pollinators have become increasingly endangered as a result of habitat degradation . The EIS does not adequately address impacts to state listed plants, such as Clatha natans ."
AQ,21, FEIS has not rectified the deficiencies previously raised by WaterLegacy regarding impacts on aquatic life resulting from polluted seepage and discharge . FEIS states that an emergency overflow channel would be constructed to discharge untreated tailings pond water as a back up means of controlling pond levels in the event of “a probable maximum precipitation rainfall event or some fraction thereof” does not specify what “fraction” of a maximum rainfall event would require emergency discharge . The MPCA has assessed and identified waterbodies that are impaired for fish and/or benthic macroinvertebrate communities .
COE,18," PolyMet proposes the single largest permitted loss of wetlands in Minnesota history . EPA letter dated February 18, 2010 to USACE Re: PolyMet NorthMet Project: Wetlands . EPA finds project may have substantial and unacceptable adverse impacts on aquatic resources of national importance ."
HAZ,16," The citizens of Minnesota will end up paying the price for improperly . High levels of toxic metals and cancer causing materials present in the ore, tailings, and waste rock, including mineral fibers, dust containing high levels of nickel, chromium, and arsenic exceeding levels mandated protective controls . There is no specific approved disposal site identified for permanent disposal of hazardous wastes generated ."
LU,15, The proposed Polymet site has the potential to affect some of Minnesota's most wonderful and environmentally sensitive places . The responsible party for the LTVSMC tailings basin should be required to deal with the existing problems and final closure and recovery of the tailings basis area .
EDIT,3," I hope that the MDNR has the capacity to modify the ‘passive voice constructions’ in this FEIS . The financial assurance section should require funding of monitoring where noted in the MDO as a future possibility as a consideration of assurance . Not defining who monitors, or how often results in failure to fund monitoring to assure that potential compliance to state law becomes a certainty ."
N,3," Some distances and directions within the SDEIS appear to be inacurate . The tribal agencies believe it is indefensible to conclude that, amidst a “mining district” with multiple active mine facilities operating in close proximity, that there is no cumulative effect of heavy industrial and blasting noise ."
