WAT,1001,"The possibility for spills and leaks; although assurances have been given that they would be minimal or none at all, is too great a risk to take in this vulnerable area. We believe that Polymet's flow studies are biased, do not rest on solid independent science, and will put a pristine northern watershed at substantial risk in future years. It is likely that they will contain numerous beneficiation reagents, elevated specific conductance, calcium, magnesium, potassium, chloride, sulfate, nickel, cobalt, and potentially zinc, as demonstrated from the Amax tailings study (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, 2004). What will be left after the mine extracts precious reserves of water from aquifers, seen and unseen, confined or not, to process metals that serve its profit margin? Unfortunately, each of these potential contingency mitigation actions, individually or in combination, actually represents a significant departure from the existing Project, as it has been defined for environmental review."
GEN,846,"With water being the resource touted as more powerful and pervasive to life on earth than oil, I am amazed that it is given so little regard in this proposal. One need look no further than the recent Animas River spill in Colorado from upstream mining...Thank you for your time, and please take my concerns to heart. after reviewing the material, i can't help but wonder what would have happened in northeastern minnesota if this review was required 125 years ago when iron mining began. From a 25 year old guy who dreams of bring his kids to this space (and fueling the economy with my gear rental, guide service, restaurant visits, etc), please do not let PolyMet go forward. Engineers have said that Polymet can handle this project with minimal risk because many engineering controls will be put in place (i.e. geomembrane, water treatment, etc....) to protect the ecosystem."
SO,325,"Temporary jobs do not justify the environmental impact that will eventually happen as we are humans whom make lots of mistakes in monitoring and doing everyday tasks. In northeastern Minnesota, there is currently a large eco-tourism and vacation economy that would be seriously negatively impacted by mining all resources including throughout the BWCA. As noted above the economy in northern Minnesota can be very cyclical; it has and will continue to have a financial impact on me personally. Both of us recently retired from good jobs here in northeast Minnesota that will not be available to others if this beautiful place turns into a mining district. Also, if something happens, like the mining waste that flowed into rivers in New Mexico this year, there will be countess jobs lost when tourism decreases as a result."
FIN,263,"But how can they make any promises about this project if there's no money to pay for all the maintenance and water quality treatment after closure? It might be a rough enough patch that PolyMet couldn’t buy or pay for renewed financial assurance “instruments.” This is entirely probable after the mine closes. Identifies a Trust Fund ($350 Million) that is short changed for required length of clean up (indefinitely) and Minnesota taxpayers will be forced to pay any shortfall. All of these should be held as responsible parties, with their assets used for any remediation, prior to the State using its financial assurance bond. By PolyMet’s own admission, the water used at its proposed mine will require 500 years of perpetual treatment—leaving a toxic legacy to our children and theirs."
PER,231,"Placing Category 1 waste rock in the West Pit, after grouting any fractures revealed by mining, may reduce adverse effects from uncaptured release of contaminated seepage to surface and groundwater. It should also establish a process that provides for refinement of modeling as additional data become available, and adjustments to the monitoring regime when necessary. History tells us that $500,000,000 five-hundred million dollars is not at all an unreasonable level of financial assurance to demand from Poly Met or any other similar project. Furthermore, if Poly Met is unwilling to provide adequate financial assurances of at least $500 million then clearly they are not serious about protecting Minnesota tax payers and our environment. Financial assurance is the taxpayer’s most important insurance policy against natural disaster, incompetence, malfeasance, negligence, and plain bad luck in connection with this mining venture."
NEPA,209,"It seems to me like you are only asking for input from those with an aptitude toward hard science such as water flows and parts per million. I realize this isn't South America, but it would be nice to have some scientific explanation of why that could never happen here. I am concerned with a conflict of interest by DNR’s Lands and Minerals mission to promote mining, yet being significantly involved in this FEIS. A problem occurs, which in this case could be anything on the list above, or many other possibilities that have not yet been recognized. Financial assurance is a component of any Permit to Mine, to ensure that necessary maintenance can be provided for as long as it necessary.242 Over the course of any project, technology changes and improves, and sometimes projects are implemented differently than predicted in an EIS where technology that is newer, better or less costly becomes available."
ALT,165,"This mine plan appears to leave behind a substantial portion of ore. GLIFWC staff has argued that the remaining ore could be accessed through underground mining methods. With toxic heavy metal leachate in the tailings pond water and sediment, every effort to safeguard against a breach should be considered responsible management. In sum, the FEIS, SDEIS, and DEIS have all failed to substantively consider many alternatives that may provide mitigation for, or prevent long-term environmental damage. While adaptive management may take many forms, to be genuine it should ensure a substantive mix of critical elements for planned and unplanned impacts that are applied over time. While adaptive management may take many forms, to be genuine it should ensure a substantive mix of critical elements for planned and unplanned impacts that are applied over time."
WET,149,"If there were no indirect impacts of the PolyMet NorthMet project on mine site wetlands whatsoever, that cumulative impact would be 10 percent. It is also unacceptable that final compensatory mitigation ratios are not included in the FEIS, and thus will be unavailable for public comment when decided upon by USACE. And although out-of watershed mitigation can be permitted, its appropriateness is usually considered at the scale of either 8-digit or 6-digit Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUCs). A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( ""Corps"") regulatory requirement, reinforced by a recent Presidential Memorandum, states ""[f]or difficult-to-replace resources (e.g., bogs, fens, springs, streams, Atlantic white cedar swamps), if further avoidance and minimization is not practicable, the required compensation should be provided, if practicable, through in-kind rehabilitation, enhancement, or preservation since there is greater certainty that these methods of compensation will successfully offset permitted impacts."" Unfortunately, the flawed hydrologic characterization and incorrectly calibrated groundwater model, along with cherry- picked analog data were used to assess indirect wetland impacts."
PD,148,"(an integral Poured Concrete tailing pond shrouded in the crushing and balling mill facility that reuses water from which all sulfides have been removed is requisite !) It seems that all other copper mines have a bad history of pollution so how is this one going to be different. If this proposal is passed, please do not let PolyMet NorthMet, nor Glencore get away with destroying the land and leaving incomplete restoration job. Let us see a 50 year demonstration of this best practice on existing mines to really understand how the technology can be employed and improved upon. These seepage flows will increase relative to the current LTV tailings basin, and create a much larger wetland than currently exists."
MERC,132,"Documents received by WaterLegacy in response to the Minnesota Data Practices Act (DPA), but not included among FEIS references, suggest that hydrometallurgical residue, for example, would contain a highly elevated level of mercury. Dr. Branfireun’s prior Opinion 4 stated that ombotrophic bogs (peat-dominated, rain-fed, acidic wetlands) play important roles in methylmercury supply, and the SDEIS improperly considered them decoupled from project impacts. Further, the existing risk is large and has not yet been addressed through a total maximum daily load (“TMDL”) or other reduction program. nan Mercury contamination is highly dependent upon species, and PolyMet’s own vendor states that methylmercury cannot be removed across an RO membrane. Should this effect also hold true at the NorthMet Tailings Basin, levels of methylmercury must be contemplated, especially during summer months."
O,132,"At 84, I'm busy on my organic farm, but will never forget that pristine area and hope you don't let anyone foul it up. Right now, other countries with less safety concern for their workers and environment are leading the way as we stand, idled by red tape. ALL of this kills life and the planet----------------why would any sane person pollute their own nest------Earth---because even birds are not that stupid! In addition to these facts it is my view along with many others that: The economic future of Northern Minnesota requires diversification away from iron ore mining. Please do not contact me w/ updates or opportunities There is a way to get yourself off the political hot seat regarding this proposal."
MEPA,105,"I hope they now live up to our high expectations and keep this EIS open until the issues noted here are fully considered. How much more danger exists for Minnesota’s waters--given the 2015 Legislative exemption of sulfide mining operations from solid waste regulations? The public needs (and deserves) to know this, especially because we are not talking about a small tract of land where PolyMet will be exempt from meeting groundwater quality standards. Given the virtually permanent and predictably devastating consequences of “getting it wrong,” basing decisions on inadequate analysis or foundation is foolhardy. It is imperative that we move forward with all haste to rebuild our mining economy and stem job losses on Minnesota’s Iron Range."
HU,94,"Three state agencies that recently backed down on their request for much more rigorous health impact analysis of the entire project offer unpersuasive rationales, apparently bowing to political pressure. A second major deficiency in the PolyMet FEIS is that cumulative health risks to downstream communities, including Duluth, Superior and Fond du Lac, are excluded. However, the FEIS does not acknowledge pregnant women or their unborn fetuses are a vulnerable population with respect to methylmercury exposure. In addition, the SDEIS does not acknowledge that elderly adults are another vulnerable population with respect to methylmercury exposure. Northeastern Minnesota has long been known for exceptionally high rates of mesothelioma—a cancer found mostly in people who live and work around asbestos."
LAN,92,"The public cannot be compromised just because a massive company invested thousands of dollars in an attempt to justify its proposal. The land exchange sets a precedent for possible future exchanges to facilitate sulfide mining, resulting in cumulative impacts and fragmentation of Forest Service lands. With the proposed land exchange, USFS would be forfeiting its authority to mining interests over lands that were set aside for protection. Minnesota law requires that state agencies (including county governments) not take final action on a project prior to the completion of environmental review. With the proposed land exchange, USFS would be forfeiting its authority to mining interests over lands that were set aside for protection."
CUM,83,"Impacts associated with United Taconite's proposal for 1,200 acres of wetland destruction to build a new tailings basin within the St. Louis River watershed should be included. Like other FEIS denials of water quality impacts based on unsubstantiated assumptions (see Sections II, III, and XI.5, supra) this cumulative effects assessment is a tautology. Lands within the 1854 Ceded Territory that have experienced urban and/or industrial development are permanently ‘lost’ as a source of treaty resources. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is considering modifying United Taconite’s Clean Water Act permit before construction begins on its third tailings basin near Forbes, Minn. A Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement is anticipated for publication in the Federal Register on August 28, 2015."
GT,78,"With such low frequency high severity losses we can never assign risk to an individual TSF based on its design and receiving environment parameters. This can be seen by looking at the horizontal accelerations (g) in Table 6-2 Summary of Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis Results (PolyMet 2015l). This can be seen by looking at the horizontal accelerations (g) in Table 6-2 Summary of Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis Results (PolyMet 2015l). Agencies and politicians would like to permit PolyMet before any more environmental disasters involving hard rock sulfide mining hit the news. Despite approval to restart, there are still no long-term plans regarding site clean-up costs, water treatment, and mining wastes management."
AIR,72,"Well that's great, too bad Sulfer dioxide is a ""major air pollutant and has significant impacts upon human health,"" according to the EPA; it also causes acid rain. This section does not mention CO2, the global impacts of which are profound for forecasting meteorological changes, including air quality and catastrophic weather patterns. What consideration has been made to the greater weather volatility being caused by climate change, which will only get worse with time? Iron ore dust might not pose a potential risk for family members, but what are the environmental and health effects of liberated copper nickel mine waste/dust? Indeed, the Copper Nickel Study explicitly expected that such an effort would be undertaken before permitting a particular project: “[T]hese estimates simply serve to highlight areas requiring further investigation."
WI,61,"Under the proposed project and land exchange, it is anticipated that Minnesota Biological Survey sites of High Biodiversity Significance would be decreased by 6,025.8 acres on Superior National Forest lands (Table 5.3.4-1, page 5-702). We have valid concerns about the Project’s impact on moose habitat at a time when their population is crashing, and they should be addressed immediately. However, depending on how elevated the sulfate levels are, water can be bitter tasting; if given a choice ruminants would generally choose other waters. So I purchased some calcium sulfate from an animal nutritionist (he has been in the business for many years; feed supplier; works with veterinarians). The state’s northeastern Moose population has not shown as rapid a decline, but is very likely to be dramatically impacted by rising temperatures resulting from climate change."
CR,59,"A Court's ""narrow function...is to determine"" whether the asserted religious belief reflects ""an honest conviction"" (See Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana Employment Security Div. In a particular way, American Indian peoples who rely on wild rice, clean water and air, thriving land, for subsistence, are affected by negative consequences of sulfide mining. Additional reconnaissance is necessary in the spring or fall when vegetation does not obscure ephemeral features such as foot trails. Further, habitat diversity that promotes long-term ecosystem sustainability represents a critical component of climate change adaptation to preserve and sustain tribal usufructuary rights. Lands within the 1854 Ceded Territory that have experienced urban and/or industrial development are permanently “lost” as a source of treaty resources."
ROD,39,"I'm told that a phone number is required for the U.s. Forest Service to consider my comment. In some cases, “proposals should be given more time for the thoughtful preparation of an EIS and development of a decision which fulfills NEPA’s substantive goals.” CEQ, Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ’s National Environmental Policy Act Regulations, Q. Many other special plant communities - some micro habitats that are easy to miss for most of us, yet still significant, and including rare species and many sites of High Biological Significance, as identified by Minnesota Biological Survey, would be traded away - in most cases with no equivalent replacement. Indeed, the Forest Service’s actions to avoid this scenario prove that it is already effectively foreseen. I oppose issuing any federal permit allowing PolyMet to destroy wetlands and impair water quality."
WILD,24,"The protection of wilderness is integral to maintaining biodiversity and preserving something that has a deep, intrinsic value for many people. Both open-pit and underground operations use massive mining equipment with ore trucks running continuously, literally for years on end. It would be shameful to disturb and destroy this space, one of few remaining natural areas on the globe. The Boundary Waters isn't just a sacred ecological place - it also contributes millions of dollars to our state economy. If not for my sake, don't allow this to mine to be built for the sake of anybody who has never heard a loon call as the sun sets over a pristine Boundary Waters lake, anybody who's never swatted mosquitoes through a muddy, wet, 250 rod portage, or anybody who hasn't yet received what this amazing, uniquely Minnesotan slice of wilderness-perfection has to offer."
VEG,22,"The status ofthe Floating Marsh Marigold should be upgraded to endangered and this (PolyMet Mine site) habitat protected. It has been proven that air pollutants inhibit the ability of pollinators to find food and pollinate plants http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-honeybees-cant-sniff-out-flowers-amid-diesel-exhaust- 20131004,0,6485580.story. Many ecosystems in the project area cannot be restored after they have been disturbed, such as spruce bogs. How will the project avoid dewatering wetland habitats associated with Hundred Mile Swamp, Mud Lake and Yelp Creek. Wild rice in the partridge and St. Louis Rivers will not be adequately protected from mine waste."
AQ,21,"For the Partridge River, data is either provided for a single year or with a single sample; and no data is provided at the genera level, so no assessment can be made whether invertebrates sensitive to conductivity are present. The FEIS states that total taxa and distribution of macroinvertebrate families (Ephemeroptera - mayflies, Plecoptera -stoneflies, Trichoptera - caddisflies) were variable, although some desirable, non- degraded stream characteristics are likely to be present. This water quality effect is specifically what the Band expected to see addressed in the FEIS, as it represents yet another potential degradation of our downstream water quality that is explicitly relevant to our stated resource management goals for name, or lake sturgeon. In this Area, the MPCA has assessed and identified waterbodies that are impaired for fish and/or benthic macroinvertebrate communities based upon recent monitoring data (since 2009). It is likely that the state-led stressor identification process will identify historic and existing mining operations as major causal factors for these impairments."
COE,18,"PolyMet’s proposed mitigation is insufficient and inadequate for the scale of wetland destruction they propose. This permit should be denied as too damaging to the public interest in clean water. Carbon sequestration services provided by forested wetlands and peat bogs must be considered in the avoidance equation alongside mitigation. If PolyMet is permitted, these wetlands will be replaced by an open pit mine and other impacts of mining, with mine waste drainage or water seepage containing toxic pollutants, in an area that now supports plant and wildlife species listed as endangered, threatened, or species of concern within the state. In addition, I oppose any federal Clean Water Act permit for PolyMet discharge and wetlands destruction."
HAZ,16,"There is complete consensus that the toxic waste will have to be contained indefinitely, far past any of our lifetimes. I consider it highly irresponsible to place this long-term burden on our descendants long after anything valuable has been extracted from the mine. Parts per million concentration levels means for every million tons containing the measured toxic component there is one ton of toxic component present, and should be accounted for in the FEIS. al Frontiers in Plant Science | PlantPhysiology July 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 268) and to aquatic animals (USEPA Gold Book 1986). The impression given is that small quantities of substances necessary for the project would be used and are classified as hazardous, and if for some reason or accident, some escaped would cause a (small) amount of environmental damage ""if not recovered in a timely manner."""
LU,15,"If that source of income and state revenue is taken away, the people in the area will have an even greater difficulty sustaining their way of life. Jay Cooke State Park was set aside for the people of Minnesota and its visitors to protect its unique features of its diverse plant and wildlife species that live along the impressive and world-known geologic features of the St. Louis River. The negative impacts of sulfide mining would turn this Minnesota gem park into an undesired wasteland. p.4-315 The study area for socioeconomics extends beyond the area of direct potential project effects to include all of Cook, Lake, and St. Louis counties (see Figure 4.2.10-1). You simply do NOT have the right to even take a chance on polluting that amazing wilderness."
EDIT,3,"I hope that the MDNR has the capacity to modify the ‘passive voice constructions’ in this FEIS (for instance the use of ‘could’ in the FEIS response to MDO#7) to an active voice in the subsequent permitting process, and to use the financial assurance section to require funding of monitoring where noted in the MDO as a future possibility as a consideration of assurance. Not defining who monitors, or how often results in failure to fund monitoring to assure that the potential compliance to state law becomes a certainty. What is the AWMP p.5-81 What is the West Equalization Basin?"
N,3,"p. 4-255 Compare directions and other indications for distances as given elsewhere in the SDEIS. Some distances and directions within the SDEIS appear to be inacurate. The tribal cooperating agencies believe it is indefensible to conclude that, amidst a “mining district” with multiple active mine facilities operating in close proximity, that there is no cumulative effect of 24 hour/day, seven days/week of heavy industrial and blasting noise on sensitive wildlife and on traditional cultural practices. See Appendix C of the FEIS for additional detail. I am also very concerned with the noise impacts from the proposed mining activities."
