This is not easy for me to say because metals are my life. However it is the right position to take. We have a cabin in Ely and see no upside to this deal. The land exchange is a horrible deal for the State. The mine plans to use old dam technology to contain waste water and slurry. There have been three large scale mining dam failures in the world within the last 18 months. The potential for pollution far exceeds the small, short-term economic gain the area might enjoy; especially given the record low prices of precious metals at this time. Please see the attached Heraeus precious metal price update. Mining companies have not been a friend to the State of Minnesota with Essar Steel being the most recent example. A small group of investors will make money if PolyMet opens and a small group of residents will be employed for perhaps 5 to 8 years. That will be the extent of the mine's economic impact. Then the investors and mining company will leave and we will have to deal with the consequences of the pollution. What will the people employed by the mine do then? The State may employ them to help clean up the pollution. Minnesota is on the map because of our natural resources. They are the most important thing we have. Our lakes and woods bring people to Minnesota from all over the world. Why would we jeopardize these resources for a possible, small, short-term gain? I realize many people in the Iron Range area support the mine. We see their signs on the way to the cabin but you have to consider the long-term, big picture. A polluted BWCA is worth nothing. No one is going to visit Minnesota to see what was once was a natural wonder. Please consider the future generations. We don't own the natural resources; we lease them from our children and grandchildren. Creating the State and National Parks weren't popular decisions at the time they were made. Today, the people responsible for their creation are revered for their forward thinking. It is time for Minnesota to say enough is enough with mining. Thank you for your time and consideration."", 'Backfilling would affect the water quality in the West Pit by increasing constituent loads, so additional mechanical treatment of water in the West Pit may be required for a certain timeframe following backfilling. However, there would be no effect on surface water quality discharged to the environmental because mechanical treatment of water from the West Pit would still be required in the long term. Response: Backfilling may actually decrease required mechanical water treatment at the site because it eliminates the Category 1 stockpile, currently identified as an indefinite source of pollution. It is hard to imagine how the treatment in the West Pit as a result of a backfill could be longer than the projected time for treatment of the Category 1 stockpile. Additionally, the potential for additional mechanical treatment is speculative at best, as the Co-Lead Agencies did not attempt any modeling to support this hypothesis. Submerging the Category 1 stockpile would remove the last permanent stockpile on the site, improving aesthetics and potentially allowing greater recreational use of the site after closure. ● Moving the waste rock from the stockpile into the West Pit would result in prolonged dust, air, and noise emissions, but these would be unlikely to exceed the respective maximum years modeled during operations. Response: Noise, dust and air emissions are only an issue during operations; perpetual active water treatment and the aesthetics of the site remain for centuries after closure. Any advantages in the latter would certainly outweigh this minimal impact.● Backfilling the West Pit would encumber private mineral resources that are deeper than the proposed West Pit. Such an encumbrance is in conflict with the terms of PolyMet’s current private mineral leases. The PolyMet lease agreements could be renegotiated, which might involve monetary compensation for the mineral owners if the minerals are encumbered. Response: As Conservation Organizations noted in 2014, PolyMet has not provided any support for this claim, including a copy of any lease or other contract. PolyMet has also not provided any support for the notion that this pit could or would be remined, something that is quite unusual.75 It would be far more likely that PolyMet or another entity would choose to expand the proposed mine deeper, perhaps into an underground mine, rather than close and reclaim the site, if the minerals underneath were found to be economically desirable. Moreover, PolyMet’s current reclamation plan also encumbers deeper mineral rights, probably beyond reach without extraordinary expense. Dr. Myers notes that to access these minerals after reclamation, “the large volume of pit lake water will need to be entirely pumped and treated to meet the 10 mg/l sulfate requirement, and the cost and time required for pumping and treating the entire pit lake prior to remining effectively eliminates this as a possibility.”76 The presence of polluted water that must be pumped and treated before discharge may be a greater burden than simply digging out additional rock.● [B]ecause of the temporal effect that the stockpile would have, the [wetlands and vegetation at the Category 1 Stockpile footprint area] would be required to be mitigated regardless of future backfilling or not. Response: The Co-Lead Agencies are confusing benefit to the company with benefit to the environment. There is still an environmental benefit to reclaiming wetlands at the site, even if the company cannot claim mitigation credits for it. There is value to wetland restoration within the same watershed, which PolyMet only partially proposes, and on-site mitigation. Additionally, as the FEIS noted, such wetland reclamation credits may be used for contingency mitigation,79 perhaps for the significant indirect wetland impacts this project is likely to have. These wetlands would offer a financial advantage to PolyMet, allowing it to save the cost of restoration for contingency mitigation elsewhere or, if PolyMet does not need the credits, it could establish a wetland bank and sell the credits to other entities, perhaps other mining companies that need wetland credits within the St. Louis River watershed.80● [T]he costs associated with backfilling, additional water treatment rates, and encumbrance compensation determined in revised lease agreements may affect the ability of PolyMet to secure financing. Response: As noted by the Conservation Organizations in 2014, this is an assertion by PolyMet offered without any support whatsoever. It is speculative and the agencies are abdicating their duty to independently verify statements by the company.82 Moreover, it gives a project proposer extraordinary and unjustified control over the alternatives analyzed if an alternative is dismissed based on an unsupported statement by the company that an alternative “may affect the ability” of the company to secure financing. The Conservation Organizations are only asking at this stage that the West Pit Backfill be given consideration as an alternative in the FEIS, not that it necessarily be adopted. The approach taken to this alternative is to speculate on its comparative benefits and drawbacks without any real information, rather than gathering the information first and then making the comparison. The Co-lead Agencies reject this alternative prior to obtaining the very information that they purport to be using to judge it.', 'The PolyMet final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was released to the public November 6th, 2015. How did PolyMet ever get this far? And why? In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated PolyMet\'s draft EIS as EU-3, Environmentally Unsatisfactory-Inadequate. Here are some quotes from the comments: ""The EPA believes that the project will exceed water quality standards because of discharges during the life of the mining operation and on a long-term basis, including the post-closure period. These water quality impacts are largely related to water that contacts acid-generating waste rock ... and to wastewater escaping the tailings basin through seeps and in ground water. ...the analyses of the hydrogeological profiles at both the mine and processing site are inadequate to determine the full extent of impacts or to justify mitigation options. Consequently we believe that the DEIS likely underestimates water quality impacts and the project is likely to have additional unmitigated long-term discharges. EPA has identified information gaps relating to groundwater impacts, groundwater-surface water interaction, tailings basin stability and containment, and groundwater discharges to surface water. Furthermore, EPA does not agree with the compensation described for wetlands impacts... The DEIS did not provide information on financial assurance..."" The above are the same concerns brought forth by environmental groups as they made their way through hundreds of pages of the DEIS. These concerns included: ""There is inadequate analysis. There is no substance to conclusions that claim there will be no water pollution. The scale of the mining operation is such that it will be impossible to contain water pollution. The tailings basin purchased from the former LTV Mining Company by PolyMet is already leaching sulfates and other pollutants into the watershed and is not designed to contain the amount or type of tailings that would be produced by PolyMet. The wetland loss at PolyMet’s NorthMet mine (nearly 1,000 acres direct/ 6,500 acres indirect) would be the single largest loss ever permitted by the St. Paul Army Corps of Engineers. The US Forest Service could deny an open pit mine operation on our public lands within Superior National Forest, rather than negotiating a land exchange that would privatize 6,500 acres of Superior National Forest lands, impacting wildlife and wildlife corridors. Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) and heavy metal pollution will be a problem for hundreds to thousands of years.""']"

The planned expansion promised a significant increase in the hydraulic gradient from the NorthMet mine site down to the base of the Peter Mitchell Pit and the potential for inter-Basin transfer of water and contaminants from the Lake Superior Basin to the Rainy River Basin. As part of work on behalf of Tribal Cooperating Agencies to analyze mine site groundwater baseflow, GLIFWC examined documents related to historic and future Peter Mitchell Pit levels. GLIFWC then communicated to Co-Lead Agencies that PolyMet’s most recent baseflow modeling erroneously assumed that water flowed out from rather than into the Peter Mitchell Pit from 1979 to 1988, resulting in an inaccurately low assessment of base flow groundwater in the upper Partridge River. (GLIFWC letter to Co-Lead Agencies Northward Flowpath & Groundwater Modeling, Aug. 11, 2015 with attachments and figures, Exhibit 8) Reviewing the expansion and closure plans for the Northshore Mine in conjunction with the PolyMet NorthMet project, GLIFWC informed the Co-Lead Agencies that “detailed (MODFLOW) and simplistic (MathCad) models predict that a northward contaminant flowpath is probable under likely closure conditions.” (Id., p. 1). GLIFWC provided attachments and figures with the August 2015 Northward Flowpath letter to illustrate both the errors in baseflow modeling and the new prediction of northward groundwater flow, given the water levels expected at closure of the Peter Mitchell Pit. GLIFWC explained that water flows downhill and that the base of the Peter Mitchell Pit at closure and the surface elevation of the Peter Mitchell Pit lake under long-term reclamation would draw groundwater from NorthMet mine site features, particularly the backfilled East Pit. The hydraulic gradient would result in groundwater flow downhill between the saturated East Pit water level (1,592 feet AMSL) and the Peter Mitchell water level at closure (1,300 feet AMSL) and under long-term reclamation (1,500 feet AMSL). (Id., p. 4, Attachments autop. 13, 27) The volume of northward groundwater flow from the East Pit may be quite significant. GLIFWC’s preliminary modeling using the PolyMet MODFLOW model suggests that approximately 90% of the post-closure outflow from the NorthMet East Pit would migrate north due to the higher conductivity of the Virginia Formation and Biwabik Iron Formation and the lower elevations of the Peter Mitchell Pit at closure (1,300 feet) and over the long-term (1,500 feet) as compared to the Duluth Complex rock and Partridge River elevation (1,548 feet) on the south of the mine site. At closure, when the Peter Mitchell Pit is 1,300 feet deep, northward outflow is estimated at 300 gpm, stabilizing at 75 gpm in long-term closure. (GLIFWC letter to Co-Lead Agencies Discharge from PolyMet East Pit at Closure, Oct. 20, 2015, Exhibit 9).', 'On August 11, 2015, the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC; the “Commission”), in coordination with its member tribes, submitted a report into the public record entitled “Comments on PolyMet mine site contaminant northward flowpath and groundwater model calibration.” The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe, a formal cooperating agency in the EIS process, is a member tribe of GLIFWC. The cited report was addressed to the co-lead agencies working on the PolyMet EIS. The Commission’s report stated the following with regard to groundwater flow at the PolyMet mine site: “Detailed (MODFLOW) and simplistic (MathCad) models predict that a northward contaminant flowpath is probable under likely closure conditions.” As the report explains, the northward flow is expected because of a “strong bedrock gradient” toward the existing Northshore Peter-Mitchell taconite mine pits located about a mile north of the PolyMet mine site. According to the FEIS, “Predicted ultimate outflow from the [Peter Mitchell pit] would be from the northeast end of the pit, to the Dunka River in the Rainy River watershed.” The Rainy River system flows through the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and into Canada. The Commission’s report goes on to state: “In addition to potential for northward flow of contaminants in the bedrock ... there is evidence that flow may be to the north in the surficial aquifer,” again related to the proximity of the mine site to the Peter-Mitchell pits. “The drawdown by the over 300 foot deep taconite pits is so great that the surficial aquifer becomes partly dewatered and all baseflow in the upper Partridge [River] ceases.” The Commission’s report conflicts with conclusions drawn by PolyMet consultant Barr Engineering, who had used the same MODFLOW computer program but predicted exclusive southward flow of contaminated waters from the NorthMet mine site to the Partridge River (a tributary of the St. Louis River in the Lake Superior watershed). As the Commission explains, Barr “incorrectly bounded and calibrated” the mine site MODFLOW model, rendering it “unlikely to generate accurate predictions.” In other words: Garbage In = Garbage Out. When Barr’s mistakes were corrected by GLIFWC staff, the MODFLOW computer program indicated that, at closure, “contaminants are likely to flow north in addition to the southward direction currently assumed by project reports.” As stated in Mazina’igan (a publication of GLIFWC), there is concern that “with such a major flaw in [PolyMet’s] evaluation of the groundwater system, accurate predictions to impacts on natural resources are impossible.” Still, for some reason the conclusions drawn by Barr Engineering with regard to exclusive southward flow of contaminated waters from the NorthMet mine site have been and continue to be relied upon by state and federal agencies charged with preparing the PolyMet EIS. Indeed, the FEIS shows little change from the PFEIS or earlier drafts in terms of its focus on the southward flowpath at the mine site. Nor is there any acknowledgement in the FEIS of the errors made by Barr in running the computer model (even though GLIFWC’s findings were issued months before the November 2015 release of the FEIS). A careful review of the FEIS reveals that, instead of incorporating the Commission’s findings into the FEIS and instituting a rigorous review of impacts likely to occur from the probable northward flow of contaminated waters from the mine site, the following new sentence was added to the EIS that, in effect, actually defends Barr’s flawed modeling: “The GoldSim model does not consider a northward flowpath north of the Mine Site facilities as there [is] uncertainty that such a flowpath would ever exist” (FEIS, p. 5-63). This makes no sense at all, based on how the co- lead agencies handled the evaluation of environmental impacts earlier in the EIS process. When Barr originally predicted a probable southward flow of contaminated waters from the PolyMet mine site, that indeed is what drove the ensuing impact analysis, an analysis that resulted in hundreds of pages of the PFEIS and earlier drafts being devoted to an examination of likely environmental impacts from the modeled southward flowpath. Now we have credible evidence that Barr’s computer modeling was flawed and that a northward flowpath is probable (using the very same computer program utilized by Barr, but this time correctly bounded and calibrated). But instead of including a rigorous assessment of potential impacts along the northward flowpath (as the co-lead agencies had required earlier for the then-deemed probable southward flowpath), the FEIS continues to lean on the earlier flawed analysis done by Barr and has devoted a mere 4 pages (FEIS, pp. 5-240 to 5- 244) to a bare-bones discussion of what would appear to be a rather complicated and costly system of “contingency mitigation measures” that perhaps could be implemented in response to a northward flowpath. The northward flowpath, now that it has been shown to be probable by the very same computer modeling program relied upon by Barr, must receive the same rigorous evaluation required by the co-lead agencies of the southward flowpath (which we now know to be flawed). That means the same kinds of analyses set forth earlier to evaluate environmental impacts along the southward flowpath must now be applied to the northward flowpath. Anything less would make a mockery of the EIS process and all of those earlier decisions made by the co-lead agencies when trying to insure adequacy in the EIS process. It’s not the State of Minnesota’s fault, the federal government’s fault, the Tribes’ fault or the public’s fault that Barr Engineering got it wrong or that PolyMet has spent the last 10 years or so providing the co-lead agencies with what we now know to be flawed information. Yet, the co-lead agencies, for whatever reason, have not required PolyMet to reconstruct its impact analysis so that the FEIS might be reflective of true site conditions. For this reason alone, the FEIS must be considered inadequate. As stated in the Commission’s report, “Evaluation of contaminant flow to the north must be conducted and impacts predicted.” What’s more, even though the corrected MODFLOW model shows the northward flowpath is probable, the FEIS states that the “contingency mitigation measures” identified for dealing with the flow of contaminated water northward will not be initially included in the financial assurance package (FEIS, p. 5-239). Again, this makes no sense at all in that it undercuts the whole idea behind financial assurance: to provide guaranteed funding for dealing with probable impacts. The State of Minnesota must not be left holding the bag for mitigation measures designed to deal with the probable northward flow of contaminated waters from the PolyMet mine site. The FEIS must be updated to not only provide greater detail regarding what those measures will be, but to require that they be initially included in the financial assurance package. Anything less would deem the FEIS to be not only inadequate, but negligent.', 'The lack of data and lack of understanding of mine site groundwater hydrology is evident in the fatally flawed MODFLOW modeling presented in the FEIS. An adequate characterization of the groundwater system at a proposed mine site is essential to understanding most of the potential impacts from the project. As stated in the GLIFWC letter to the co-lead agencies of August 11, 2015: “The amount of water entering the groundwater system, be it precipitation or discharge from the bed of lakes, rivers or mine pits, determines the direction of flow and dilution of contaminants, and dictates points of compliance for both ground and surface waters. The horizontal and vertical conductivity of the soil and bedrock materials determines how the groundwater system responds to stresses and the rate at which the groundwater flows horizontally and vertically. The character of interaction between surface water features and the groundwater system, whether it is loss of water from rivers or wetlands to the groundwater system, or discharge from the groundwater system to the surface water features, determines predicted impacts to surface water features by stresses such as mine dewatering. Estimating water budgets and quantities of water that must be treated requires an adequate understanding of the groundwater system. None of the above effects of a mine project can be predicted accurately if there is not an adequate characterization of the groundwater system. Without an integrated model of the groundwater system, one would be left with only professional judgment to determine the value of the many interrelated parameters that are used for impact prediction. Professional judgment is useful in checking the reasonableness of the predictions from a groundwater model but, by itself, cannot adequately integrate the complex site specific information, all pieces of which must fit together like a complex puzzle.” MODFLOW is the primary source of information for defining flowpaths of contaminants from the NorthMet Mine pits at closure. The flowpaths are used to define the area of potential effect for cultural resource impact analysis. The flowpaths and the speed of groundwater flow from the MODFLOW model are critical inputs into the GoldSim water quality model. In fact, without MODFLOW results, the GoldSim model could not be run. Thus the outputs generated by GoldSim that predict ultimate water quality parameters in the Partridge River and property boundary points of compliance are not accurate. MODFLOW is fatally flawed for one simple reason. It was calibrated to conditions that did not exist at the same point in time. Water levels in the Northshore taconite pits from 1996 were used along with Partridge River baseflows from 1979- 1988. In addition, the modeling does not incorporate the predicted Northshore pit elevations at closure which would be significantly lower in elevation than the bottom of the NorthMet pits. This approach is contrary to accepted modeling methodology and constitutes an unacceptable calibration error. These concerns were described in detail in comments on the CPDEIS of 2008 emailed to the lead agencies on February 6th, 2009. It is unclear why the lead agencies have failed to correct an error of this magnitude. GLIFWC staff have corrected the calibration error in the applicant’s model. When corrected, the model indicates that the majority of bedrock groundwater flow from the NorthMet pits and Category 1 stockpile will be to the north toward the Northshore Mine pits and not to the south as described in the FEIS. See GLIFWC letters to the co-lead agencies dated August 11 and December 14th for more information. This 180 degree change in flow direction is significant because it invalidates all mine site water resources conclusions in the FEIS regarding water quality at closure. Furthermore, the water quality effects to Birch Lake and the Boundary Waters of Northshore Mine pit water mixing with NorthMet pit effluent have not been evaluated. The co-lead agencies now agree that GLIFWC’s assessment of the MODFLOW model is correct and that the northward flowpath results when the correct water elevations in the Northshore pits are used. However, the co-lead agencies have adopted an idea developed by the applicant to claim that the north flowpath is unlikely. The idea is that a groundwater mound has/would form in bedrock north of the NorthMet Mine pits and would prevent northward flow of pit water through bedrock at closure. This mound cannot form given the hydrogeologic setting of the area. In fact it is physically impossible for a mound to form. See GLIFWC letter of December 14th for additional detail. A webinar and teleconference was scheduled by the co-lead agencies on November 17th, 2015 to discuss the inadequacies of the MODFLOW model and the flawed understanding of mine site hydrology presented in the PFEIS. Since that time, the co-lead agencies have refused to discuss this issue with tribal cooperating agencies and intertribal agencies. In an email dated November 30th, 2015 the co-lead agencies communicated that there would be no additional technical engagement with tribal staff on the topic. GLIFWC staff have attempted to engage in this discussion and continue to provide information to the lead agencies. GLIFWC staff have developed the following technical comments letters: • Dec. 13, 2015. Titled: ""Comments on NorthMet FEIS and Section 404 permitting Re: Hypothetical groundwater mound between PolyMet and Peter-Mitchell pits"" • Dec. 14, 2015. Titled: ""Comments on NorthMet FEIS and Section 404 permitting Re: Mine site groundwater model calibration."" • Dec. 15, 2015. Titled: ""Comments on NorthMet FEIS and Section 404 permitting Re: Likely northward groundwater flowpath of contaminants."" The assessment of hydrologic impacts of the proposed NorthMet mine does not meet the minimum standards of scientific integrity. The co-lead agencies assumed early in the process that bedrock groundwater flow would be to the south at closure. They have since attempted to support their pre-conceived notions about hydrology with information that runs contrary to physical reality. The NEPA process is not well served by this approach.']"
1,178,1_land_exchange_forest_lands,"['land', 'exchange', 'forest', 'lands', 'service', 'national', 'federal', 'the', 'rights', 'treaty']","['WE object to the U.S. Forest Service proposal to exchange Superior National Forest land for the PolyMet proposal and urge the U.S. Forest Service to reject the proposed exchange of Superior National Forest lands for the PolyMet project;', 'The FEIS also fails to describe the foreseeable impacts of the no action alternative at the mine site. According to the Draft Record Of Decision (DROD): the reason the Forest Service is conducting this land exchange is that if it does not, PolyMet is likely to litigate its right to build an open pit mine on Forest Service property acquired under the Weeks Act, and the outcome of that suit is uncertain. In other words, the Forest Service believes that there is a significant chance that the no action alternative would result in an open pit mine on Forest Service land. Although we agree that this outcome is not certain, if it is foreseeable enough that the Forest Service is trading away a ten-square-mile contiguous piece of property with irreplaceable resources in order to avoid it, it is surely certain enough to assess in the FEIS. Indeed, the Forest Service’s actions to avoid this scenario prove that it is already effectively foreseen. The Forest Service has the established right to impose conditions on mining operations to protect natural resources in situations like this one, where the Forest Service owns the surface and a private party owns the mineral estate.102 Because the mine as proposed would violate so many of the provisions of the Superior National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan), the Forest Service would undoubtedly impose many additional requirements if the mine were to be built on Forest Service land. The Forest Service cannot assume for the purposes of NEPA that an open pit mine on Forest Service land would have the same impacts as an open pit mine on non-Forest Service land. We understand that the Forest Service does not want this mine on its property, and we can hardly blame it. We also understand that the Forest Service sees an advantage in obtaining other land in exchange. But neither we nor the Forest Service know that this is the environmentally preferable outcome, and the FEIS does nothing to enlighten us. The whole point to the NEPA process is to look at the actual expected environmental effects of the range of alternatives in a given situation. In this particular situation, it is unclear that there will be any on-the-ground environmental benefit of Forest Service ownership of the nonfederal lands, as opposed to the current owner. Will water quality, vegetation, wildlife, or ecosystem services benefit from the change of ownership? FEIS that goes into this alternative at length. On the other hand, would these natural resources benefit from Forest Service ownership of the mine site, if a mine will be built regardless? The FEIS tells us absolutely nothing about this possibility. The Forest Service is hiding behind its legal position when it says that if there is no land exchange, there will be no mine. But the Forest Service cannot have it both ways. If an open pit mine on the Superior National Forest is foreseeable enough to drive this entire action, it is foreseeable enough to require assessment under NEPA.', 'The land exchange would be bad public policy. Turning ownership of National Forest Lands over to a private mining company would be contrary to the Forest Service’s mission: it would not serve the people well and it would demonstrate the very opposite of caring for the land. The land exchange would be in direct opposition to long-standing federal policy that protects wetlands: it would result in the direct destruction of 914 acres of wetlands as well as the destruction or impairment of up to 7,694 additional acres of wetlands. More, it would apparently degrade surface waters and groundwater to the extent that they would not meet state, federal and tribal water quality standards. The ROD does not acknowledge, nor does the FEIS weigh heavily enough, the harm that would be done to vulnerable species, including moose, lynx, and northern goshawks. The ROD and the EIS do not indicate serious consideration of the loss of ecological services so that all of those benefits can be weighed against the mining company’s gains. This exchange would mean the destruction of 700 acres of imperiled Black Spruce – Jack Pine Woodland, now protected as part of the Superior National Forest, and among our favorite places for birding, botanizing, and hiking. Many other special plant communities - some micro habitats that are easy to miss for most of us, yet still significant, and including rare species and many sites of High Biological Significance, as identified by Minnesota Biological Survey, would be traded away - in most cases with no equivalent replacement. Lands that the Forest Service would gain ownership of in the exchange are for the most part already used in ways that are consistent with the Forest Plan. There is no great advantage, in terms of land use, in bringing them under Forest Service management. The meager list of benefits to the Superior National Forest derived from the exchange doesn’t begin to offset the loss of habitat, water quality, ecological services, ecological health, and recreational uses. There has been no analysis of the cumulative impact of similar deals involving transfers of public lands and access to minerals to the mining and drilling extraction industry across the nation. In these transactions the value of the lands is transferred from the public to industry investors (who are often not U.S. corporations or citizens) with relatively little or no value flowing back to the public. The interests of future generations, the uncountable numbers of which obviously have an even bigger stake then we present day citizens do, are not represented. And although industry benefits from these deals, taxpayers foot the bill for the years of work that public land managing agencies dedicate to facilitating deals requested by industry. Consideration of this proposal should have included documentation of the time and money the Superior National Forest has invested in this exchange over the past decade and show how that weighs against impacts to ecosystem components and benefits/losses to the public, as well as the big picture view of how this fits into similar actions across the U.S. Public Lands System, or at least in those lands managed by the USFS.']"

Based on U.S. and Minnesota history of mining pollution and other serious environmental damage from industrial pursuits, I have no reason to believe that this mining would be conducted in a way that would not damage the environment--and the humans that treasure and depend on it for our lives and livelihoods. The few jobs that would be provided by a copper-nickel mine could destroy just as many jobs by damaging an environment that must remain pristine in order to support a vibrant tourism industry, and in order to provide clean drinking water, edible fish, safe swimming, and non-toxic soil to support food plants and natural ecosystems. I have no trust in either regulators or PolyMet to conduct copper-nickel mining AND safeguard the environment. As a former canoe guide in the Boundary Waters and Quetico; as someone already concerned about toxins in Minnesota fish that I would like to eat; as someone acutely aware of how much I depend on a clean, healthy environment for my well-being, and as a daily user of copper and nickel in the infrastructure of my life: I object to this mine. We can recycle copper and nickel that have already been mined. We can also find and create alternatives to the ways we use these metals.

5,71,5_wetlands_wetland_indirect_mitigation,"['wetlands', 'wetland', 'indirect', 'mitigation', 'impacts', 'effects', 'feis', 'the', 'of', 'and']","['17.2.4 The FEIS fails to explain how the proposed mitigation complies with the law. As stated above, state and federal law requires mitigation for lost or degraded wetland functions when those effects cannot first be avoided. PolyMet currently proposes to mitigate only direct impacts to site wetlands and proposes to mitigate the majority of those negative effects outside of the Lake Superior watershed. The only explanation for why the Co-Lead Agencies believe this is acceptable is because mitigation sites were “difficult to find” within the watershed. This runs counter to the Friends’ and MCEA’s own expert analysis312 and the FEIS fails to provide adequate detail for the public to understand and judge whether rejection of certain sites was proper. Further, even if it is true that there are no acceptable mitigation sites within the watershed, there is nothing in the law that then excuses PolyMet from application of the avoid and mitigate requirements. If the impacts cannot be avoided, they must be mitigated. If they cannot be mitigated they cannot be allowed. The Co-Lead Agencies’ position in the FEIS appears to be that the law is only a strong suggestion or guidance, to be complied with if to do so is relatively easy. This approach would render the law meaningless and that is outside the Co-Lead Agencies’ authority. The apparent lack of mitigation opportunities within the watershed further raises questions with respect to PolyMet and the Co- Lead Agencies’ failure to address expected indirect impacts (discussed above) now, before the impact occurs. Again, that is not compliant with the temporal requirements for mitigation in the law and the FEIS provides no explanation for how the Co-Lead Agencies think it might be. Further, it highlights the fact that mitigating for likely future indirect impacts will be difficult within the bounds of the law. If the Co-Lead Agencies properly require mitigation for the entirety of indirect effects to the Hundred Mile Swamp functions and for expected indirect effects given what is already known about flow between PolyMet’s east pit and Northshore, thousands more acres of wetland must be mitigated. If the Co-Lead Agencies already know that mitigation sites are severely limited, moving forward and allowing impacts nonetheless is irresponsible and not compliant with the law. As MCEA states in the SDEIS comments, thousands of acres of wetlands may be affected with no potential mitigation option identified much less provided before the effects occur. In addition to the out-of-watershed and temporal violations inherent in the current approach, the FEIS pays lip service to mitigating functions lost, but it provides no real discussion of how PolyMet will in fact “mitigate” or “restore” coniferous bog wetlands, and in particular how PolyMet will recreate a groundwater-fed fen. The suggestion of as much borders on ridiculous. The scientific literature is replete with statements about how it is nearly impossible to mitigate bogs, how it has rarely (if ever, depending on how success is defined) been done successfully, and that therefore, damage to these wetland types should always be avoided. The Conservation Organizations are unaware of any example of a fen being mitigated. And the FEIS appears to recognize this when it continues to talk about “targets” for mitigation314 admitting that if the coniferous bog and swamp restoration is unsuccessful then targets will simply be readjusted to be whatever PolyMet actually comes up with in the mitigation effort. The so-called targets concept does not comply with the law’s requirement to fully replace lost functions and is in fact more of a “moving target” for mitigation. Finally, given the out-of-watershed proposal and obvious difficulty with actually mitigating the functions that will be destroyed within a timeframe wherein those functions will actually be replaced, the FEIS provides a somewhat incoherent discussion of mitigation ratios. At some level the FEIS provides for 2:1 but then engages in lengthy speculation regarding reducing those ratios to 1:1. The charts showing mitigation acres actually show that coniferous bog will not be mitigation on a 1:1 basis; it appears that PolyMet will rely on coniferous swamp at their Aitkin site for some of those acres, a failure to meet the mitigation requirements of replacing full function. The Co-Lead Agencies must require 2:1 as the minimum replacement ratio for all wetland effects from the PolyMet project. There is no scientific, legal, or factual support for anything less.', 'In the FEIS, there is no commitment to advance mitigation for indirect impacts to wetlands. Instead, it proposes monitoring changes in hydrology, vegetation and other indicators for the wetlands in places where indirect impacts are expected to occur. Although it acknowledges that mitigation may be required, no mitigation plans will be developed until after impacts are detected. Using a monitoring approach to determine whether mitigation is needed is insufficient for several reasons. First, the kinds of indirect impacts identified in the FEIS, especially those caused by groundwater drawdown, are reasonably foreseeable and permanent: the technical literature from across the U.S. leaves little doubt that such impacts are not only possible, but likely. Second, wetland monitoring programs established for regulatory purposes have a poor track record of being able to detect impacts before they occur. In many instances, such monitoring programs have been insensitive to impacts even after they started to occur, leading to uncertainty and dispute about the cause of the impacts until damage is already severe or irreversible. Finally, allowing impacts to occur before requiring mitigation contradicts the Corps\' governing mitigation principles that ""[i]mplementation of the compensatory mitigation project shall be, to the maximum extent practicable, in advance of or concurrent with the activity causing the authorized impacts."" This situation may result in a loss of wetland function during the time between detecting impacts and mitigating for them, a contradiction to the no-net-loss policy that governs mitigation under both state and federal law. The FEIS is inadequate due to its failure to respond to concerns about the lack of advance mitigation for foreseeable, permanent indirect impacts to wetlands. These indirect impacts will have an effect on an estimated 6,500 to 7,700 additional acres, acreage over and above the 913 acres directly impacted and previously addressed in these comments. While the FEIS does commit to advance mitigation for 26.9 acres of impacts from wetland fragmentation, this still leaves a substantial amount of impacted acreage uncompensated. By not providing mitigation until impacts are detected, there is a high likelihood that a temporal loss of wetland function could occur. II. Summary of Necessary Action on Wetlands and Mitigation.1. Meaningful alternatives should be developed for mitigating wetland impacts that include different combinations of in-kind restoration, enhancement and preservation, and alternative options for mitigation sites that satisfy the selection criteria set forth in the Federal Mitigation Rule including permanent protection of wetlands within the St. Louis River watershed. 2. Mitigation for all direct and indirect impacts to all bog, fen and lowland conifer wetland types should be developed using replacement ratios of at least 2: 1. 3. Financial assurance estimates for mitigation of direct and indirect wetland impacts should be developed and financial assurance should be required in an amount sufficient to cover full costs to complete the work and meet all applicable performance standards at alternative sites by a third party. 4. An explicit commitment should be made and plans should be developed for advance mitigation of all reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts to wetlands identified in the FEIS. 5. As part of the EIS process, the agencies should solicit and consider public comment on mitigation alternatives and plans, including those for indirect impacts, and on financial assurance for ensuring success of mitigation for direct and indirect impacts.', 'We disagree with the rational provided in the FEIS for performing the indirect effects analysis for wetlands. On page 5-259 in Section 5.2.3 .1.2, the FEIS states ""The indirect effects analyses performed for the EIS were not performed to characterize impacts but were done to inform where monitoring should take place for those areas that were identified as having a potential for indirect wetland effects. The Co-lead Agencies agree that multiple actors can affect whether a wetland would experience indirect effects due to a project. This FEIS quantitatively assessed all potential indirect wetland effects from the NorthMet Project Proposed Action that may result from one of the following six factors: 1) wetland fragmentation; 2) changes in wetland hydrology from changes in watershed area; 3) changes in wetland hydrology from groundwater drawdown resulting from open pit mine dewatering; 4) changes in wetland hydrology from groundwater drawdown resulting from operation of the Plant Site, including groundwater seepage containment; 5) changes in streamflow near the Mine Site and Plant Site, as well as associated effects on wetlands abutting the streams; and 6) change in ·wetland water quality related to atmospheric deposition of dust and rail car spillage associated with Mine Site and Plant Site operations. The methodology and evaluation criteria used for assessing potential indirect wetland effects are described in detail below. The monitoring and mitigation for potential indirect effects would be determined during permitting. Section 5.2.3.3 of this FEIS includes a detailed discussion on the monitoring and mitigation plan for the indirect wetland effects. The proposed wetland impact, avoidance, minimization, mitigation and monitoring plan presented in this FEIS would be reviewed, modified as required, and approved during permitting; therefore, this information could change during permitting."" This does not meet the NEP A requirements for an EIS. The purpose of an EIS is to inform potential impacts that may result from the project and not just where monitoring should take place. If the project detects impacts to wetlands after the start of operations instead of understanding where impacts could/would occur before operations, it will be too late to evaluate ways to avoid those impacts and mitigation (assuming proper mitigation is feasible) will be the only option. The analytical methods and data necessary to estimate the potential indirect impacts on wetlands is available and should be used as such in the FEIS. Please revise/remove this statement and context from the FEIS. The project as a whole puts too emphasis on using adaptive management in lieu of collecting additional data where data is lacking and performing analyses to better characterize and estimate potential impacts.']"

FINANCIAL ASSURANCE The PolyMet NorthMet FEIS not only fails to specify the level of financial assurance that will be required for the NorthMet sulfide mine project, as previously requested by WaterLegacy. The FEIS fails to provide either the conceptual or factual basis from which an appropriate calculation might be made either by the MDNR for a permit to mine or by the Army Corps for a Section 404 permit. Even to the limited extent that the FEIS addresses financial assurance, it does so poorly, placing much of the risk of externalities on the public rather than on the PolyMet Company, or its parent company and joint venturer - the entities that would profit from the mine. On a conceptual level, the FEIS does not recognize that the only time in the life cycle of a mine when government agencies have any leverage to secure adequate financial assurance is before permits are issued. When a mine is operating, leverage shifts to the mining company, which can threaten closure when asked to pay costs of mitigation or assurance, irrespective of its actual profits. After a mine closes, bankruptcy is likely, particularly when the mine is a limited liability company’s only asset. Unless post-closure contingencies are specifically required to be assured up front, the FEIS’ repeated insistence that PolyMet “would be held accountable for maintenance and monitoring required under the permit and would not be released from financial assurance until all permit conditions have been met,” (e.g. FEIS, 3-5, 3-59, 3-72, 3-127, 3-140) carries no weight. Once an insufficient instrument is exhausted and the mine has closed, taxpayers and the public will be unprotected. The FEIS contains specific statements as well as gaps in analysis that virtually guarantee that financial assurance will be inadequate. 1. The FEIS improperly deferred to the project proponent to set financial assurance. The FEIS implies that PolyMet would play a central role in determining the amount of financial assurance needed. The text states that “PolyMet would ensure that the financial assurance amount is established as a function of (but not limited to) the following three main variables Extent of surface disturbance and potential releases from waste storage facilities Reclamation and long-term care standards (including mechanical water treatment) and Reasonable assessment of the costs to execute the Contingency Reclamation Plan.” (FEIS, 3- 142). That this unfortunate language relates to PolyMet’s role in setting financial assurance levels, rather than the company’s role in financing the level required in the public interest is supported by the next sentence, “PolyMet has developed preliminary cost estimate ranges that address the above items for hypothetical closure at years 1, 11, and 20.” PolyMet’s estimate, the only one mentioned in the FEIS, is then summarized. PolyMet’s cost estimate for closure is $50- 90 million in Year 1, $160-200 million in Year 11, and $120-170 million in Year 20. (Id.). As discussed below, PolyMet’s estimates minimize legacy costs and wastewater treatment costs, exclude risks of poor quality modeling and “unexpected” outcomes, deny and minimize assurance to compensate for wetlands impacts and provide no resources for corrective actions resulting from either routine or catastrophic failures. 2. The FEIS financial assurance estimate discounted existing legacy pollution costs. The only estimate of financial assurance in the FEIS - PolyMet’s estimate - is inconsistent with PolyMet’s disclosure to shareholders of the liabilities associated with legacy pollution. In PolyMet’s Form 20-F, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in April 2015, PolyMet estimated total costs to indemnify Cliffs for reclamation and remediation obligations assumed in PolyMet’s Purchase Agreement as “approximately $72.6 million in present day costs.” PolyMet summarized the litigation against Cliffs and the 2010 Consent Decree applicable to the acquired property and disclosed for investors, “based on the expected timing of such payments, our cost of capital, and anticipated inflation rates, we made a provision of $72.3 million in our financial statements at that date.” (PolyMet Form 20-F, filed Apr. 21, 2015, pp. 18-19, Exhibit 23). PolyMet noted in its disclosure to the SEC, “there is substantial uncertainty related to the long-term mitigation plan implementation cost” and that outcomes “that are unfavorable to us could result in material additional liability.” (Id., p. 19). Before a shovel reaches the site, PolyMet has already estimated that $72.3 million is needed to provide for legacy liabilities. Any financial assurance for the NorthMet mine project must be over and above that amount. Simple arithmetic discloses the discount of legacy pollution costs in the FEIS’ estimate of financial assurance. 3. The FEIS provides no foundation to assure long-term water quality treatment. The FEIS provides no factual foundation from which financial assurance for long-term water quality treatment could be reasonably calculated. The PolyMet NorthMet draft EIS predicted that waste rock stockpile leachate collection would exceed water quality standards for up to 2,000 years. (DEIS, Table 4.1-45, p. 4.1-80, FEIS reference MDNR et al. 2009). Responding to comments of Tribal Cooperating Agencies suggesting that water treatment would need to be perpetual, the Co-Lead Agencies stated numerous times, “Modeling predicts that treatment activities will be a minimum 200 years at the Mine Site and a minimum of 500 years at the Plant Site. While long-term, these time frames for water treatment are not necessarily perpetual.” (Tribal Comments and Co-Lead Agencies’ Dispositions, Aug. 19, 2013, attached as Exhibit 24). An EIS with similar language would provide a basis to calculate financial assurance for water quality treatment. The FEIS provides no such foundation. It states that PolyMet would include funds in its contingency reclamation estimate and financial assurance package to operate mechanical water treatment “for as long as necessary.” (FEIS, 3-81). Although the FEIS admits that the potential effects of the PolyMet NorthMet project are “based on mechanical treatment that would operate indefinitely” (FEIS, 5-8), the FEIS itemization for the financial assurance package in long-term post closure only provides for testing and implementation of non-mechanical water treatment. (FEIS, 3-81). While admitting that the effectiveness of non-mechanical water treatment has not been demonstrated, in listing the long-term post-closure monitoring and maintenance activities that must be assured, the FEIS does not include any provision for WWTP treatment of polluted tailings seepage. The FEIS only provides for “Developing and implementing non-mechanical water treatment systems.” (FEIS, 3-141). Minnesota has experience with post-closure use of non-mechanical water treatment to treat mine discharge when a taconite mine encountered Duluth Complex rock. It is not positive. At Minnesota’s Dunka Mine, non- mechanical water treatment, implemented when the mine went bankrupt and closed its treatment plant, has resulted in consistent violations of Minnesota numeric as well as narrative water quality standards.44 Replicating this cheap and ineffectual plan for the PolyMet NorthMet mine project would be the opposite of financial assurance. 4. The FEIS improperly excluded contingency mitigation from financial assurance. Presumably in response to concerns about assumptions in PolyMet’s modeling of seepage concentrations, seepage capture, and the absence of northward flow, the FEIS has a long list of contingency mitigation and conceptual mitigation options to address the potential that the project will not operate as “expected” and that polluted seepage would flow north to the Boundary Waters watershed. (FEIS, 5-239 to 5-244). It would be reasonable for regulators to require that PolyMet assume the risks of the errors in its modeling or overreaching in its promises. This could be done by financially assuring contingency mitigation and retaining funds pending verification that the PolyMet NorthMet mine site, tailings and hydrometallurgical residue facilities operate as modeled and claimed. The FEIS improperly excludes contingency mitigation from the financial assurance package until some unspecified future time if “appropriate and approved” by the MDNR and MPCA. (FEIS, 5-239). Given the potential that pollution would be discovered after mine closure due to seepage times and the relationship between northward flow and Northshore Peter Mitchell Pit closure, plus the difficulty in securing remediation in Minnesota from an operating mine, let alone a bankrupt mine, it is highly unlikely that funds for contingency mitigation would be secured at a future time if they were needed. By excluding contingency mitigation from financial assurance rather the providing a basis for quantifying these costs, the FEIS has effectively externalized to the public PolyMet’s risk of modeling and performance failures. 5. The FEIS excluded and undermined assurances for wetlands mitigation. The FEIS provides no basis to financially assure compensation for the indirect effects of the NorthMet project on wetlands. By providing no assessment of reasonably foreseeable impacts from hydrologic changes and pollution (see discussion in Section V, supra), the FEIS precludes assurance that compensation will be available when wetlands near the NorthMet mine or tailings site are indirectly destroyed or impaired. Even for direct', 'The Financial Assurance for the project is not given any detailed analysis in FEIS, even though this information is available from the mining company. The rationale for this decision is given as: The level of engineering design and planning required to calculate detailed financial assurance amounts is not currently available, .... This is clearly not the case. Any responsible mining company will need to know what the potential financial liabilities of post-closure costs will be in order to provide a proper, and legally-required for the company’s investors, financial estimate of the profitability of the proposed project. In fact, PolyMet has stated: Although NEPA and MEPA regulations do not require a discussion of financial assurance, PolyMet has provided an initial estimate of expected financial assurance needs that could be included in environmental review process (Reference (11)). (PolyMet 2015g, p. 35) The problem with presenting at least a preliminary financial assurance calculation appears to be with the agencies, not with PolyMet. The level of detail available from the company is likely more than sufficient to provide a detailed estimate of the financial assurance. This estimate would provide the public with two very important pieces of information: (1) The magnitude of the financial surety amount; and, (2) Most importantly, the methodology which will be used to calculate the final financial surety. It is an important part of the EIS process to know approximately how much money will need to be provided as a financial surety for closure and post-closure requirements, and that appropriate procedures and inclusive items are being used to estimate this amount. The financial surety clearly has the potential to affect the human financial/social environment, and is an estimate for which the information is clearly available at the EIS stage. It is noted in section 1.4.5 Financial Assurance, that: Minnesota Rules, part 6132.1200 requires that before a Permit to Mine can be granted, financial assurance instruments covering the estimated cost of reclamation should the mine be required to close for any reason at any time must be submitted and approved by the MDNR. (FEIS, p. 1- 18) Even though a financial analysis is required “before a Permit to Mine can be granted” this critical element is not disclosed in the FEIS. In addition to the claim that this level of detail available is not sufficient – which is clearly not true – this is also justified by asserting: There are no applicable federal financial assurance requirements that would be incorporated into the Permit to Mine,... (FEIS, p. ES-55) The financial assurance for post-closure is a very important financial element of this project because longterm water treatment will be required. If the assumptions used in calculating the financial assurance for long-term water treatment are not inclusive of all potential costs, or if the assumptions for long-term investment return and/or inflation are not conservative enough, then the public will either be saddled with paying for the long-term water treatment with public funds, or the public will suffer the environmental impacts of not treating this contamination. These are potential significant impacts on the public. A Federal agency must prepare an EIS if it is proposing a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment (the Army Corps of Engineers and the Forest Service are co-preparers of this EIS). In 40 CFR Chapter V - Council on Environmental Quality, Part 1502 - Environmental Impact Statement § 1502.1 Purpose.

(emphasis added) In 40 CFR Chapter V - Council on Environmental Quality, Part 1508, Terminology and Index, it states: Section 1508.14 Human environment “Human environment” shall be interpreted comprehensively to include the natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment. (See the definition of “effects” (Sec. 1508.8).) This means that economic or social effects are not intended by themselves to require preparation of an environmental impact statement. When an environmental impact statement is prepared and economic or social and natural or physical environmental effects are interrelated, then the environmental impact statement will discuss all of these effects on the human environment. (emphasis added) A financial surety that is not adequately calculated could have an impact on the human environment as described in the CEQ regulations, and therefore should have been analyzed in the FEIS. The “preliminary cost estimate for closure” for NorthMet is as large as $200 million during operation (FEIS, p. 3-142). In addition, it appears that this cost estimate is for closure costs only, and does not include post-closure water treatment. It is typical that post-closure water treatment costs are as large as the direct closure costs, and if this is the case then the amount for the current financial surety is being considerably underestimated.', 'The Financial Assurance for the project is not given any detailed analysis in FEIS, even though this information is available from the mining company. The rationale for this decision is given as: The level of engineering design and planning required to calculate detailed financial assurance amounts is not currently available, .... This is clearly not the case. Any responsible mining company will need to know what the potential financial liabilities of post-closure costs will be in order to provide a proper, and legally-required for the company’s investors, financial estimate of the profitability of the proposed project. In fact, PolyMet has stated: Although NEPA and MEPA regulations do not require a discussion of financial assurance, PolyMet has provided an initial estimate of expected financial assurance needs that could be included in environmental review process (Reference (11)). (PolyMet 2015g, p. 35) The problem with presenting at least a preliminary financial assurance calculation appears to be with the agencies, not with PolyMet. The level of detail available from the company is likely more than sufficient to provide a detailed estimate of the financial assurance. This estimate would provide the public with two very important pieces of information: (1) The magnitude of the financial surety amount; and, (2) Most importantly, the methodology which will be used to calculate the final financial surety. It is an important part of the EIS process to know approximately how much money will need to be provided as a financial surety for closure and post-closure requirements, and that appropriate procedures and inclusive items are being used to estimate this amount. The financial surety clearly has the potential to affect the human financial/social environment, and is an estimate for which the information is clearly available at the EIS stage. It is noted in section 1.4.5 Financial Assurance, that: Minnesota Rules, part 6132.1200 requires that before a Permit to Mine can be granted, financial assurance instruments covering the estimated cost of reclamation should the mine be required to close for any reason at any time must be submitted and approved by the MDNR. (FEIS, p. 1- 18) Even though a financial analysis is required “before a Permit to Mine can be granted” this critical element is not disclosed in the FEIS. In addition to the claim that this level of detail available is not sufficient – which is clearly not true – this is also justified by asserting: There are no applicable federal financial assurance requirements that would be incorporated into the Permit to Mine,... (FEIS, p. ES-55) The financial assurance for post-closure is a very important financial element of this project because longterm water treatment will be required. If the assumptions used in calculating the financial assurance for long-term water treatment are not inclusive of all potential costs, or if the assumptions for long-term investment return and/or inflation are not conservative enough, then the public will either be saddled with paying for the long-term water treatment with public funds, or the public will suffer the environmental impacts of not treating this contamination. These are potential significant impacts on the public. A Federal agency must prepare an EIS if it is proposing a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment (the Army Corps of Engineers and the Forest Service are co-preparers of this EIS). In 40 CFR Chapter V - Council on Environmental Quality, Part 1502 - Environmental Impact Statement § 1502.1 Purpose. The primary purpose of an environmental impact statement is to serve as an action-forcing device to insure that the policies and goals defined in the Act are infused into the ongoing programs and actions of the Federal Government. It shall provide full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and shall inform decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment. Agencies shall focus on significant environmental issues and alternatives and shall reduce paperwork and the accumulation of extraneous background data. Statements shall be concise, clear, and to the point, and shall be supported by evidence that the agency has made the necessary environmental analyses.

Sitting at the top of both of these watersheds, PolyMet will add higher levels of sulfates to the downstream waters. Sulfates in the Partridge and Embarrass rivers, and in the St. Louis River downstream from them already greatly exceed normal background levels because of drainage from taconite mines to the north. Much additional sulfate will be added to these watersheds as a result of the PolyMet project. Higher levels of sulfates in downstream waters will allow microbes to convert more of the available mercury to methylmercury, which is the bioaccumulating formulation that contaminates our fish, and humans eating those fish, boosting already unsafe levels of methylmercury contamination in these waters. The PolyMet project will also add more mercury to these river systems. Release of mercury sequestered in peat soils, increases in water level fluctuations, and airborne mercury released from the PolyMet mine and plant sites will all contribute to the already high levels of mercury in the system. The St. Louis River was listed for mercury impairment by the PCA in 1998. Since then little progress has been made to come up with a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plan to get the river delisted. By adding more mercury and sulfate to the river system, the PolyMet project will make it even more difficult to accomplish this challenging goal to make the fish safer for people to eat. The FEIS does not answer the question of how the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (PCA) can meet the goal of cleaning up the water in the St. Louis River, while at the same time adding more mercury and sulfate pollution to it.', 'adequate. Cooperating tribes and intertribal agencies have raised mercury and methylmercury as concerns since the pre- draft environmental impact statement review of 2008. Methylmercury is a bioaccumulative neurotoxin that disproportionately impacts tribal populations that depend on fish for a subsistence diet. While the FEIS mentions this issue, the co-lead agencies have refused requests to properly characterize the additional influx of methylmercury to the St. Louis River as a result of wetland and saturated overburden excavations at the mine site. Predicted mercury loadings as a result of the NorthMet Project continue to constitute a Major Difference of Opinion (MDO) between the Co-lead and Tribal Cooperating Agencies. Again, the co-lead agencies have not been receptive to tribal input and thus the issue remains. The FEIS states that, based on mercury mass balance analyses, the NorthMet Project would result in a net increase in mercury loadings to the Embarrass River of 0.2 g/year (from 22.3 to 22.5 g/year), which would be offset by a 1.2 g/year net decrease in mercury loadings to the Partridge River (from 24.2 to 23.0 g/year), resulting in a combined overall decrease in mercury loading to the St. Louis River of 1.0 g/year. We disagree with the treatment of mercury in the FEIS and the resulting conclusions in three fundamental ways. In contrast to what is laid out in the FEIS, it is our expert opinion that: I. Increased mercury loadings to the Embarrass River may not be permittable. A net decrease in mercury loadings to the St. Louis River does not justify or make acceptable the increased mercury loadings to Embarrass River. II. The mass balance analyses that lead to the conclusion that mercury loadings will not increase in the St. Louis River are flawed in numerous ways. Mercury loadings to the St. Louis River are in fact likely to increase as a result of the NorthMet Project. III. While mercury loadings to the Partridge, Embarrass, and St. Louis Rivers are discussed, there is no adequate consideration of the fact that more of the mercury entering these systems will be in the form of methyl, rather than inorganic, mercury. This has the potential to greatly impact fish tissue mercury in these systems and the subsequent risk to fish consumers, both human and wildlife. Each of these three points is explained, in brief, below. I. Increased Mercury Loadings to the Embarrass River are not Legally Permittable. The Embarrass River flows through a chain of lakes including Wynn, Sabin, Embarrass, and Esquagama Lakes. Each of these lakes are on the 303(d) Impaired Waters List for mercury in fish tissue. In addition, Wynn and Sabin Lakes are on the proposed 2014 303(d) Impaired Waters list for mercury in the water column. According to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Friends of Pinto Creek vs. the U.S. EPA (“The Carlota Decision”), a new discharge that would further degrade waters with existing water quality impairments cannot be permitted. The decision further clarified that the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) does not have a provision that allows for “trades” in which increased pollutant discharges to one waterbody can be offset by decreases to another. Therefore it appears that under the CWA, a new source such as the NorthMet Project cannot discharge additional mercury to these mercury impaired waters. According to the FEIS, the NorthMet project would increase mercury loadings to the Embarrass River (which includes the lakes through which it passes) by 0.2 g/year (from 22.3 to 22.5 g/year). This does not appear, based on the Carlota Decision, to be permittable. Similarly, based on the Carlota Decision, it does not appear that the additional loading can be offset by decreases in mercury loadings to the Partridge River, as argued in the FEIS.', ""Mercury bioaccumulation in fish can harm the fish themselves, inhibiting fish reproduction. (FEIS, 5-467). As summarized in the opinion of Dr. Saracino quoted in Section VIII, supra, consumption of fish containing high levels of methylmercury (the form of mercury that bioaccumulates in the food chain) can also be harmful to human beings, particularly to the developing fetus, when methylmercury crosses the placental barrier. (Saracino, 2015). In Minnesota’s Lake Superior Region, the cumulative risk of mercury contamination of downstream fish is highly significant and should have been evaluated. A recent Minnesota Department of Health study found that 1 out of 10 infants in Minnesota's Lake Superior region were born with unsafe levels of mercury in their blood. At a statistically significant level, a greater proportion of Minnesota babies had unsafe mercury in their blood as compared with babies in the Lake Superior region of Wisconsin or Michigan. Mercury levels were also higher in Minnesota in the summer months, suggesting that increased consumption of locally caught fish during the warm months is an important source of pregnant women's mercury exposure.50 In addition to a 1.3 ng/L standard for mercury in the water column discussed previously, Minnesota has a standard limiting mercury in edible fish tissue to protect human health, which is applicable across the range of waters used for fishing and drinking water, of 0.2 micrograms per kilogram (μg/kg). Minn. R. 7050.0220, subp. 3a, 4a, 5a. This standard is lower than the EPA’s methylmercury criterion for fish tissue (0.3 mg/kg) because of the high rate of fish consumption in Minnesota.51 The Embarrass River chain of lakes downstream of the proposed NorthMet tailings site - Sabin, Wynne, and Embarrass Lakes -- are impaired due to excessive mercury in fish tissue. Colby Lake, into which the Partridge River flows downstream of the proposed mine site, is also impaired due to excessive mercury in fish tissue. (FEIS, 4-29, Table 4.2.2-2). Based on the sampling done for the NorthMet project, the Partridge River and Embarrass River may also be impaired for aquatic consumption due to excessive mercury. Mean concentrations of mercury at surface water sites in the Partridge River (2.3 to 5.4 ng/L) and mean concentrations in the Embarrass River (4.3 to 5.1 ng/L) are two to four times higher than Minnesota’s water column standard of 1.3 ng/L. (FEIS, 4-41, Table 4.2.2-4). Most of the St. Louis River downstream of the proposed NorthMet sulfide mine project is impaired for the designated use for aquatic consumption as a result of excessive mercury in fish tissue. (FEIS, 4-285). Exhibit 28 to WaterLegacy’s comments identifies segments of the St. Louis River that are on Minnesota’s Section 303(d) impaired waters list due to excessive mercury in the water column or mercury in fish tissue.""]"

Impacts associated with United Taconite's proposal for 1,200 acres of wetland destruction to build a new tailings basin within the St. Louis River watershed should be included. The NorthMet project would add to the load of pollutants in the St. Louis River and would reduce tributary flows to the river. Impacts that may occur due to the project could be underestimated (due to modeling concerns), and would not stop before reaching the St. Louis River. Further, any added impact from the project to the St. Louis River watershed would in turn impact Lake Superior. We believe that this is the appropriate scale to analyze cumulative effects for these resources."", 'The FEIS fails to include the value of the natural capital of the St. Louis Watershed when mitigating the wetlands for the Polymet Project. Natural capital is defined as “minerals, energy, plants, animals, ecosystems, (climatic processes, nutrient cycles and other natural structures and systems) found on Earth that provide a flow of natural good and services” (Daly and Farley, 2004). Two of the three mitigation sites for this project are not in the watershed thus result in a loss to the St. Louis Watershed area.

To date about $750,000,000.00 has been spent to clean-up from the industrial pollution disaster of the St. Louis River watershed area. It is still unsafe for certain human populations to consume fish from the river without heeding the MN Dept. of Health’s warning guidelines. It is still considered an endangered river without the additional impact of sulfide mining. The amount of short-term proposed economic gains or benefits from the Polymet project in comparison with the costs of jeopardizing the long-term environmental economic value of the St. Louis River watershed should not be given any more consideration. Therefore, I am against the MNDNR giving the NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange project a green light. I’m asking them to state, “No Alternative Action”, in their decision on the FEIS. I am also asking the USACE not to issue any 404 permits to the Polymet project. The USAD Forest Dept. should not agree to any land exchange.

There were instances during the operation of the LTVSMC Tailings Basin where significant amounts of fine tailings and slimes settled near the perimeter dams. (4.2.14.2.2 Development of the Existing LTVSMC Tailings Basin, p. 4-427) It is proposed to use Cement Deep Soil Mix (CDSM), and other measures like drains, to stabilize the tailings in order to allow upstream dam construction to continue. Also noted in the FEIS is that the geometry and physical changes to the embankments (such as CDSM) were incorporated into the design so that all computed slope stability Factors of Safety met or exceeded the Factors of Safety required by the NorthMet Geotechnical Modeling Work Plan (PolyMet 2015l, Attachment A). It is also noted in the Geotechnical Data Package for the Tailing Basin (PolyMet 2015l) that: The appropriate approach hinges on the extent, composition and continuity of stringers within the deposit as subsequently described. Several types of evidence support the conclusion that heterogeneity within the deposits is localized, so widespread and continuous stringers of the weakest material (slimes) are unlikely and isotropic parameters are appropriate. (PolyMet 2015l, p. 63, emphasis added) This is a necessary assumption for time-efficient modeling. It is also a critical assumption in terms of keeping the costs of the modeling task in a reasonable range. However, if this assumption is wrong, even in relatively local regions of the dams, then the modeling is wrong. To illustrate the complexity of the tailings near and under the dam structures, Figure 5.2.14-6 for cross section F of the tailings basin, the most critical cross section in terms of potential instability. Cross Section F, which intersects the northern dam of Cell 2E, as shown in Figure 5.2.14-4, was selected to represent the critical cross section for stability analysis purposes as it is the maximum section based on height as measured from the downstream toe to the proposed final crest, some layers of the weaker fine tailings and slimes extend close to the dam, and the original starter dam is underlain by peat. (FEIS, p. 5-657) The dam in the area of Cross Section F (see Figure 5.2.14.6 on the following page) will also require underdrains in order to provide long-term stability (PolyMet 2015l, p. 73). This building complexity only raises the chances for misinterpretation and oversimplification in the modeling. Simpler models are better. The Cement Deep Soil Mix columns are designed to provide more weight bearing capacity in the tailings to attempt to justify further upstream-type dam construction.

These comments identified concerns related to the proposed NorthMet tailings waste storage facility. As a general matter, Dr. Chambers noted that tailings dams fail at a rate that is approximately 10 times higher than that of water supply reservoir dams. (Id., p.2) Dr. Chambers also stated that upstream-type dam construction poses the highest risk for both seismic and static failure of tailings dams and that most tailings dam failures have been associated with upstream construction. Referring to the SDEIS, he noted that the NorthMet tailings facility would use upstream dam construction for its expansion, and would also need to depend in part on the safety of the design and construction of the old upstream-type LTVSMC dams. (Id., pp. 2-3).Dr. Chambers highlighted the presence of a clay layer beneath a portion of the Mount Polley dam as a significant cause of its failure, explaining that the LTVSMC tailings slimes on which the NorthMet project’s tailings dams will be built have a consistency and behavior similar to clays. (Id., p. 3). The FEIS confirms both that the LTVSMC dam was built with upstream construction and that PolyMet still plans to use upstream construction for its tailings storage on top of these old dams. (FEIS, 4-439, 5-646). The FEIS also notes that there were times during the operation of the underlying LTVSMC tailings facility where “significant amounts of fine tailings and slimes” settled near the perimeter dams and dams were then built with coarse tailings on top of them. (FEIS, 4-427) This inclusion of “relatively large zones” of fine tailings and slimes in the dam’s outer shell “reduces the drainage ability of the shell, increasing the phreatic surface, and reduces the localized shear strength” of the dam. (Id.). The FEIS identifies the northern dam in Cell 2E as an area of potential weakness since it is “underlain by a layer of fibrous peat up to approximately 20 ft thick that extends north beyond the toe of the dam into a nearby wetland and due to the presence of interbedded layers of contractive fine tailings and slimes.” A deposit of glacial till lies beneath the peat, and the crest of the dam in this area is about 90 feet above the surrounding ground surface and “consists mostly of coarse tailings with some weaker layers of interbedded fine tailings and slimes close to the base of the dam.” (FEIS, 4-437). Fully liquefied, this cross-section of the dam (Section F) has a margin of safety at barely the 1.1 minimum required. (FEIS, 5-658, Table 5.2.14-1). PolyMet’s Flotation Tailings Management Plan (PolyMet 2015n) states that there are 34 homes that could be affected by a tailings dam break, and that the time to first arrival of flood flows at the nearest residence would be about an hour. (Id., p. 20). The map illustrating the flood path, provided on the last page of PolyMet’s Plan, is attached as Exhibit 22. However, the FEIS does not include any Dam Break Analysis. “The potential effects of hypothetical failure scenarios have not been assessed in this FEIS.” (FEIS, 5-628). WaterLegacy does not argue that the NorthMet tailings storage facility dam will fail, only that such failure is reasonably foreseeable and may have catastrophic consequences. Assessing these consequences is necessary for decision-makers to understand the risks of PolyMet NorthMet tailings disposal and evaluate alternatives to minimize these risks.']"

(Id. ) Yet the risks of ""bust"" cycles are addressed only incompletely and indirectly in the FEIS through the use of commodity prices that are characterized as generally conservative, compared to price trends. In particular, copper... prices used in the IMPLAN model are significantly below recent average prices. (Id.) The prolonged downward trend in the price of copper exposes the shortcomings of this approach. Although the current economic expansion is entering its 78th month and is among the longest in U.S. history,"" the current spot price for copper is around $2.10 per pound, well below the $2.90 per pound price used in the IMPLAN model.\' In fact, copper prices have been falling since 2011 and have been below $2.90 per pound for most of the current year- despite larger than normal supply disruptions. Many analysts expect copper production to remain high and copper prices to remain low for many years to come thanks to several large, seasoned low-cost producers, including a huge existing mine in Indonesia with 2016 production costs expected to be $0.61 per pound?', 'There are good reasons to believe that PolyMet in fact will not continue in operation, and may even cease to be a going concern, in the event of a prolonged downturn in copper prices. Not the least of these reasons are PolyMet\'s own statements to this effect. For example, in its public financial disclosures, PolyMet states: Because the price of metals fluctuate, if the prices of metals in our ore body decrease below a specified level, it may no longer be profitable to develop our NorthMet Project for those metals and we will cease operations...If the prices of copper, nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium and gold are, for a substantial period, below our foreseeable costs of production, we could cease operations. Project. Ifwe are unable to raise such additional funds, we will have to suspend or cease operations...Ifwe cannot raise the money necessary to continue to explore and develop our property, we will have to suspend or cease operations...We have had no production history and we do not know if we will generate revenues in the future...While we were incorporated in 1981, we have no history of producing minerals. We have not developed or operated any mines and we have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. We currently have no mining operations of any kind .... We may not successfully establish mining operations or profitably produce metals at any of our properties. As such, we do not know if we will ever generate revenues...We have a history of losses, which we expect will continue for the future. If we do not begin to generate revenues we may either have to suspend or cease operations.

Historically, sulfide mining has not been a clean process, resulting in massive amounts of environmental pollution, and in many cases, this was when the mines were not located near delicate ecosystems, pristine wilderness, and massive bodies of water. PolyMet insists that it is capable of overcoming that stigma, but I believe we should be doubtful. One of the more recent examples occurred in the US: the Brohm Mine in South Dakota accidentally produced acid mine drainage, one of the side-effects of which was turning a nearby stream more acidic than lemon-juice. The company in charge of the mine ended up going bankrupt. Only 1/8 of the clean-up costs were paid by the company because of the bankruptcy. The rest of the clean-up was paid for by American taxpayers. If the PolyMet mine were to end up polluting the surrounding wetlands and other ecosystems, it would have to be fully responsible for paying for the clean-up, no matter how long or intensive the process. I would also like to point out that just because a company can, does not mean they should. Just because PolyMet has proven they can meet pollution standards on paper, does not mean they will be able to do so in action. Just because PolyMet is capable of creating 620 acres of mining area and removing just over 88 million pounds of copper, nickel, cobalt, and precious metals from those mines, does not mean that it is the best course of action. Instead of focusing on the importance of unspoiled wilderness areas or clean water sources, people are being blinded by greed and desire to become the first to tap untouched natural resources.

The two principals involved in the fraud, as at PolyMet, were Mr Cherry, then Project Manager, and Mr Donahue of Foth Engineering who, to quote him, ""Knows how to get permits"". We still have the evidence. It is significant that Kennecott never denied wrongdoing. In court they would stroke their mustaches thoughtfully and change the subject. We allowed them to do that. Everything was under control. A ""Done Deal"". The EPA had earlier delegated power to MDEQ to handle all mining regulation in Michigan, without having mining expertise, but they ignored real expert advice and handed out the permits.

They simply denied it, without evidence. The judge took a nap.

It is unfortunate that many within the environmental community will perceive the affirmative conclusions of this analysis as a defeat when this study represents the pinnacle of their advocacy. The environmental impact analysis process generally, and this exhaustive and technically complex environmental study specifically, was never intended to be an absolute barrier to future mining in Minnesota. It is, rather, a profoundly deliberative process designed to give our elective leaders, our regulatory agencies, our citizens, and the market itself an objective framework by which to judge whether State and Federal environmental standards can be achieved and maintained within the NorthMet proposal. Three independent agencies: the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Corps of Engineers, lead this massive and lengthy analysis. That all three INDEPENTLY concluded that the Northmet mining project can be compatible with both the environmental and natural resources of the region (and the outdoor recreational pursuits based on those resources) is both reassuring and conclusive regarding the adequacy of this EIS. Ultimately, the permitting process, the financial assurance component and the world-wide metals market itself will determine if this proposed mine is both environmentally and economically feasible. The state and its federal partners will, through the multitude of mine permit performance standards, a sound financial assurance facility, and a continued high level of transparency and public dialog ensure that the environmental management component of that decision is fully manifest.

These systems are assumed to collect more than 90 percent of the leachate from these mine features, and this collection rate is critical to all of the predictions of water quality impacts from this project. If these systems do not operate as assumed, the increases in pollutants in surface and groundwater at both the mine and plant site will be significantly higher than predicted in the FEIS, to the point of violating or increasing violations of water quality standards for some constituents. For systems modeled at 99 or 100 percent capture efficiency, a change of even one percent could double the amount of pollutants predicted to enter ground and surface water. In response to questions about the adequacy of the capture systems, the FEIS contains new information showing modeling of the operation of the capture systems.177 Dr. Tom Myers has provided a comprehensive review of this modeling.178 As Dr. Myers concluded regarding the Tailings Basin system, The FEIS’ statement “[m]odel results indicate that all seepage from the Tailings Basin would be captured along the north and northwest flowpaths under all assumptions of the bedrock fracture zone thickness” is true only because the model was set up in a highly biased fashion. The model was set up to confirm: “These results indicate that the Plan site Goldsim model assumption (that groundwater seepage equal to 10 percent of the aquifer’s transmissive capacity bypasses the Tailings Basin containment system) is conservative” The model was hardwired to show what the modelers were told by Polymet to make it show. The evidence for this is that the model parameters do not resemble the parameters used for other modeling and the boundaries were set to create hydraulic barriers and sinks that will not be present in the field.179 In his review of the SDEIS, Dr. Michael Malusis also identified numerous questions and concerns regarding the barriers. For the Category I Waste Rock Stockpile, EIS documentation: lacks information on soil content and a potential additional barrier in the wall; indicates an incorrect liner will be used for a vertical wall; is based in part on missing information (i.e. broken links in reference materials and missing documents referenced) and insufficient explanation; presumes an unrealistic permeable conductivity rate for the vertical barriers; lacks information on keying walls to bedrock; is not clear about wall thickness; and indicates an insufficient surface slope which will lead to ponding and infiltration. The Tailing Basin’s groundwater seepage containment system’s documentation similarly lacks information on wall keying and inward gradient, and indicates a wall thickness that will be too difficult to construct and backfill properly and is not consistent with conventional practice. It appears from the response to comments that no significant additions were made to the FEIS to correct these many omissions and mistakes. As discussed above, reliance on a mitigation measure to avoid disclosing possible impacts of a project requires sufficient evidence for the assumption that the mitigation measure will work as planned, and/or a disclosure of the degree of risk that it will not work as planned along with information about the potential impacts if it does not. Instead of providing this assessment, the FEIS and Response to Comments tell us that the barrier and capture system is both a well-established technology, and a new technology for which historic information about the efficacy of such systems is irrelevant. In hailing the groundbreaking uniqueness of the capture systems, the Response to Comments states: The Co-lead Agencies acknowledge that there are existing water containment systems at other mine sites that do not operate with a high degree of capture, but these are different designs and cannot be directly compared to the system proposed for the NorthMet Project Proposed Action. The proposed containment system uses pumping on the tailings side and reinjection on the downgradient side to reverse hydraulic gradients across the slurry wall and in underlying bedrock. Relatively few containment systems have been built with this degree of pumping and reinjection to ensure effective capture. The conceptual hydraulics of this type of system provides evidence that it would achieve complete or nearly complete capture.180 In other words, the Co-lead Agencies are not relying on evidence that this technology has worked at this level of capture before. The only evidence it has for its assumption of greater than 90 percent capture (and in some places, 100 percent capture) is “conceptual hydraulics.” However, the FEIS states in another place that The proposed containment system technology is not new nor unique; the slurry cutoff wall and collection trench approach has been used for many decades, beginning initially as a means to facilitate construction of deep foundations in locations of shallow groundwater and difficult soil conditions, and subsequently expanding to other uses such as the containment of contaminated groundwater emanating from unlined waste disposal facilities (e.g., landfills, stockpiles, etc.). There are many papers written about the use of groundwater containment systems and a number of contractors well-experienced and proficient in containment system construction.181 The comment that this text responds to specifically challenges the assumption that the capture efficiency will be greater than 90 percent.182 Thus the response that the proposed technology “is not new or unique” and “there are many papers written” about it refers to a “unique” technology for which the agencies have no evidence other than conceptual hydraulics. Notably, no citations are provided for the papers. Similarly, in response to comments that the chosen control technologies have never been proven in this type of mining, the agencies cite to a 1986 USACE manual in support of the statement: “Design criteria for the Tailings Basin are based on well-established geotechnical design standards with significant precedent in Minnesota, in the greater United States, and worldwide.”183 In short, the agencies tout “significant precedent” for use of slurry wall technology when commenters point out the complete lack of information on the practical, as-built efficacy of the reverse hydraulic gradient system. And when commenters point out the ineffectiveness of slurry wall technology as shown by “significant precedent,” the agencies tout the uniqueness of the hydraulic system. In neither situation is the comment actually responded to. Despite this attempt to confuse the issue, it is clear that the Co-lead Agencies have no documented examples of situations in which this type of system has worked at the level of accuracy that the FEIS assumes. Given that these walls will be miles long and that the systems will need to continue operating for hundreds of years, assumptions that they will operate perfectly defy belief. Our expert reports provide many reasons to doubt these assumptions. In light of the lack of precedent and the resulting uncertainty in the capture rate of these systems, one would think that the amount of leachate escaping from the Category I Stockpile and the Tailings Basin would be set as variable factors in the GoldSim modeling, allowing a picture of what might happen if the']"

Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies ‘to insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence’ of an endangered species or ‘result in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species...’ This language admits of no exception. Section 7 of the ESA mandates that “federal agencies take no action that will result in the ‘destruction or adverse modification’ of designated critical habitat.” “Destruction or adverse modification” of critical habitat is defined as “a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of the critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.” The courts have found that this regulatory definition reads the “recovery” goal out of the statutory adverse modification inquiry, “and that agencies must in fact consider impacts that appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat for either survival or recovery. ""Thus, the agencies’ assessment of the impacts of a proposed action on a listed species’ critical habitat must address the project’s potential impact on the species’ habitat in terms of the species’ recovery as well as its survival. In addition, agencies are not allowed to characterize as “insignificant” the potential impacts on a species’ critical habitat by considering only the broad scale or long-term impacts. The NorthMet Mine Site is within designated critical habitat for the Canada lynx and gray wolf, and signs of lynx and wolves have been observed near and at the Mine Site. The proposed mine would reduce suitable habitat for lynx and wolves, and fragment their remaining habitat. Significantly, the proposed mine would destroy two square miles (1454 acres) of critical habitat for lynx and wolves for at least 40 years.363 Moreover, the mine would further affect lynx and wolf critical habitat through impacts to two of the remaining wildlife corridors in this region. Because the proposed mine would result in the destruction and adverse modification of critical habitat for both the Canada lynx and gray wolf, the project violates Section 7 of the ESA and cannot proceed. In addition to the direct impacts on lynx and wolf habitat at the Mine Site, an average of 2066 miles per day of vehicular traffic is expected within the site, with an additional 1734 miles of traffic each day between the Mine Site and Plant Site. This does not include additional highway traffic from workers driving to and from work, or truck traffic delivering supplies. The agencies acknowledge that increased vehicle and train traffic could further affect lynx and wolves, including through vehicle collisions.', 'Also missing is cumulative-impacts analysis of culturally-important plant and animal species that are listed as “Species of Concern.” For example, a substantial moose population has been identified in the mine site area by aerial and ground surveys. Moose are likely to be impacted by the disturbance of two of the few wildlife corridors remaining along the Mesabi Range, not to mention by the massive wetland impacts of this project. The rationale for a comprehensive cumulative impacts analysis for moose is found, again, in the MNDNR’s own statements. This Co-Lead itself, in its Statement of Need And Reasonableness (“SONAR”), related to Minnesota’s List of Endangered, Threatened, and Special Concern Species, in 2012 proposed listing moose as a species of “special concern:” Between 1990 and 2000, the northwestern Minnesota Moose population underwent a substantial decline, and a 2007 Minnesota DNR aerial survey determined that as of that date, fewer than 100 Moose comprised the northwestern population. Aerial surveys currently estimate the northeastern Minnesota population at roughly 4,230 individuals. The northwestern Minnesota Moose population decline occurred in less than a decade. Recent surveys document a slow decline in the northeastern Minnesota Moose population.266 MNDNR directly linked this decline to climate change, land ownership, and forest management practices: Increased temperatures are likely to increase heat stress and lead to increased mortality within the state’s remaining Moose populations. Changes in land ownership and changes in forest management practices within the state’s Moose range may be having a significant adverse effect on the quantity and quality of the species’ habitat within the state, and particularly on thermal refuges in warmer weather. The state’s northeastern Moose population has not shown as rapid a decline, but is very likely to be dramatically impacted by rising temperatures resulting from climate change. This will likely lead to a marked decline in this population within the foreseeable future.267 There is no basis to dispute that the Project will have cumulative effects on the moose herd and Tribal harvest in the 1854 Ceded Territory. At a time when moose populations in Minnesota are declining, this analysis is particularly important and should have been done as part of this FEIS.', '22.0 The Co-Lead Agencies Fail to Assess Direct and Cumulative Impacts on Wildlife. The FEIS fails to assess the cumulative impacts on sensitive wildlife species, which the FEIS defines to include federal and state-listed species, species of special concern, and Forest Service sensitive species.463 This issue was raised in our comments on the SDEIS at MCEA 118 and CBD 73-75, which are attached and incorporated herein. We also submitted a supplementary letter to Forest Supervisor Brenda Halter on October 8, 2015, which we incorporate herein. The FEIS neither mentions this issue in its Response to Comments, nor includes material in the text of the FEIS that responds to the issue, in violation of 40 C.F.R. § 1503.4(a) (agency must consider and respond to comments) and 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(b) (agency must discuss in FEIS “any responsible opposing view,” and “shall indicate the agency’s response to the issues raised”). The FEIS claims that the cumulative effects analysis for wildlife “focuses on potential losses to sensitive wildlife species.”464 In fact, however, the FEIS provides only a few pages of very general information, with the vast majority of sensitive species not even mentioned. There is therefore no scientific support for the agencies’ conclusion that the proposed NorthMet mine, along with all other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions, “would not further threaten special status wildlife species.”465 Although Chapters 4 and 5 of the FEIS list many species of concern that either are found at the project site or for which the project site provides habitat, and Chapter 5 at least purports to assess the impacts that the NorthMet project alone would have on these species, Chapter 6 provides no comparable analysis for cumulative impacts. And yet almost all of the species of concern are on the list of Regional Forester Sensitive Species (RFSS) due to current or expected cumulative losses of habitat across their range within the region.466 Without an analysis or explanation of the ultimate impact on these species from cumulative losses and how the NorthMet project would contribute to those losses, the FEIS does not provide the “hard look” at impacts required by NEPA. NEPA requires the Forest Service to consider the potential cumulative effects of proposed actions.467 “To ‘consider’ cumulative effects, some quantified or detailed information is required.”468 “Without such information, neither the courts nor the public, in reviewing the [agency’s] decisions, can be assured that the [agency] provided the hard look that it is required to provide.”469 “General statements about ‘possible’ effects and ‘some risk’ do not constitute a ‘hard look’ absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.”470 In its cumulative impacts analysis for wildlife, the FEIS provides only very general statements concerning risks and impacts, which falls far short of the detailed and quantified analysis required by NEPA. The sum of the assessment is found in three statements. First: Cumulative effects on wildlife may include the loss and/or fragmentation of habitat and encroachments into critical wildlife travel corridors...471 Second: In addition to habitat fragmentation and loss and effects on wildlife crossing corridors, wildlife species of concern in the Nashwauk Uplands and Laurentian Uplands ecological subsections are subject to other stressors that could result in cumulative effects. Traffic and activity related to mining projects, urban development, forestry, tourism, and road expansions all increase the risk for special status wildlife species and, as such, could result in cumulative effects.472 And finally, in regards to wildlife travel corridors: Wildlife could be affected by the NorthMet Project Proposed Action and other actions through a cumulative disruption of their travel corridors. These actions could pose additional barriers to wildlife movement by increasing the number of isolated patches of suitable habitat, increasing mortality during transit, and physically blocking travel. This may lead to increased population and genetic isolation and decreased meta- population dynamics, which in turn could lead to decreases in overall population stability and persistence. The FEIS provides additional cursory information about the approach it used to reach this “assessment,” including the spatial boundaries; the timeframe; the list of past, present, and foreseeable future actions considered; the causes of habitat changes; the vegetation types of affected habitats; and the list of wildlife corridors and projects affecting them. But aside from a couple of brief paragraphs on federally-listed species (which are addressed below), the three statements quoted above are all the cumulative assessment says about the actual impacts on wildlife. The FEIS provides no information on the status of or impacts to any specific species. As an example of what is missing, the FEIS tells us that loss of wildlife habitat in the Laurentian Uplands will be due primarily to timber harvest and mining, while losses in the Nashwauk Uplands will be due primarily due to mining and urban development.474 But it completely fails to tell us what those losses are expected to be, or how they will impact specific species. Without explaining why more detailed and quantified information cannot be provided, these very general statements are insufficient and fail to comply with NEPA.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected a similar cumulative effects analysis for a proposed mining project. In Great Basin Mine Watch v. Hankins, the court struck down the agency’s reliance on the same sort of brief, generalized descriptions of mining impacts in the region.476 The court required the agency to include “mine-specific ... cumulative data.”477 Relying on prior cases, the court highlighted the need for a “quantified assessment of [other projects] combined environmental impacts” and “objective quantification of the impacts.”478 The FEIS for the proposed PolyMet mine similarly fails to provide the required detailed analysis of cumulative impacts. Moreover, the cumulative effects analysis entirely fails to even mention moose, despite the documented presence of moose in the area, its rapidly declining population and designation as a species of special concern, its iconic status to the citizens of Minnesota, and its cultural significance to the Tribes. The agencies’ failure to address such a fundamentally important issue violates NEPA. Chapter 5 of the FEIS acknowledges that the proposed mine by itself “would likely affect moose individuals in the vicinity through habitat loss and fragmentation”;480 cumulative impacts to moose and moose habitat should be obvious. As noted by the Tribal cooperating agencies in their comments on the initial DEIS for this project, the Minnesota advisory committee studying the decline of the moose population in northeastern Minnesota recommended preserving wetlands as sanctuaries for moose from heat stress.481 Yet PolyMet is proposing the largest wetland fill ever permitted in this region, and additional losses will follow with other mining activity. Wetland mitigation for the PolyMet project will be located outside of the area that still supports a moose population, as will the largest tract of the replacement lands that the Forest Service will receive in the land exchange. This loss will undoubtedly be joined by other losses of wetlands throughout Minnesota’s remaining moose territory, but the FEIS provides no information on what the extent of those losses is likely to be.

Such a tragedy could easily pollute our drinking water, lakes, rivers, streams, and aquifers for generations to come. At a time when drinking water is being poisoned by fracking and phosphate runoff from industrial agriculture, forests in western states are burning up square miles at a time and cities on the Pacific Coast are rationing water consumption, we are seriously considering risking polluting our principal natural resource in perpetuity. And all for a limited economic benefit that will come calling again in twenty years to further erode our precious water. There can be no justification for this intentional despoilment. We have a one hundred and thirty year history of relatively successful iron ore mining in Minnesota. In over a century, we have learned, by and large, how to regulate this mining process. Sulfide mining is a completely different proposition. Can we believe that we can regulate these mining companies effectively, when we do not have the institutional memory or resources in our regulatory bodies to stay ahead of the mining companies’ natural propensity to embrace expediency? There is no contest. If the provisions for financial assurance fail to impose the full cost of the externalities of the PolyMet mining venture on the prime beneficiary of this project, PolyMet’s shareholders, this Permit to Mine should never be issued. We will never have more negotiating power over PolyMet, and by implication, all other sulfide mining ventures waiting in the wings, to protect the environment and ensure that sulfide mining is conducted responsibly than we do at this very moment. If this project must move ahead, the DNR must make up for its lack of experience in sulfide mining by hiring the best independent advisors available and structure a model financial assurance design, implementation and management process. In addition, financial assurance must become an integral part of the EIS process. Specific to PolyMet, the public must be made aware of the details of the determination of the financial assurance amount and how its integrity will be maintained over the life of the project, after the spotlight has moved on. The public must also be allowed to comment on the detail prior to the issuance of the permit. I particularly urge you to avoid all appearance of back-room dealing by fully disclosing for public comment prior to permitting, the financial assurance details.', 'Let’s consider the policy for use of Minnesota’s Boundary Waters wilderness area. The theory behind sustained use of this wonderful resource is that of “leave no trace.” If you bring it in – carry it out. If we examine the negative effects of sulfide mining in other states and in other countries, what we find is that if sulfide minerals are left by mining operations in a condition where contact with the environment is allowed, big-time problems occur. Invariably it is we the people who then must deal with the ramifications of these problems. In order to render the mining industry to be environmentally sustainable, we the people, through those we entrust with the general welfare, must hold the mining industry to a “leave no trace” standard. I call on Governor Dayton and his upper management team to be stewards of our environment not for the short-term monetary profits of a few but for the benefit of Minnesota’s posterity now and for many future generations. Let me describe one specific example of how not to proceed. The Brohm mine at the now established Gilt Edge superfund site was approved in 1987 by the SD board of Minerals and Environment as supported by the SD Department of Environment and Natural Resources on Governor George Mickelson’s watch, in the face of solid scientific evidence that mining sulfide ore using Brohm’s plan would lead to a huge environmental problem. Ten or so years into the mining operation, the environmental problems had materialized and in the face of the financial consequences, Brohm Mining, Inc. (the company incorporated to protect the parent company and investors from financial risks) declared bankruptcy. South Dakota could not afford to treat the contaminated water from the mine site let alone do the cleanup, so Bill Janklow (to the applause of those who’d profited from the mining operation) passed the problem to the EPA. The problem is now the Gilt Edge superfund site and the costs to “we the people” of the remediation of the problem will likely exceed the value of the gold recovered by the entire mining operation. Let’s not have a Berkely Pit or a Gilt Edge site in Minnesota. I have no arguments whatsoever with the environmental provision proposed during the active mining period. I believe that with significant oversight from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency as supported by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, environmental measures put in place during active mining will adequately protect the sensitive watershed within which the PolyMet site is situated. Conversely, I know that if allowed to proceed based on the currently-proposed closure/reclamation plan the PolyMet mine will be a legacy problem. I call on Governor Dayton and Minnesota’s environmental stewards to hold PolyMet to a closure/reclamation plan that leaves no sulfide bearing rock, tailings or hydrometallurgical wastes on the Earth’s surface for ultimate eventual contact with atmospheric oxygen and ultimate distribution of produced toxics to Minnesota’s waters by natural hydrologic processes. Governor Dayton and his team of high-level managers within the DNR and MPCA should individually and collectively look out for Minnesota’s resources as they would look out for their own children, perhaps holding Minnesota’s environment as closely to their hearts as they might hold an only child. We have but one environment and no risk should be considered reasonable for that environment that would not be deemed appropriate for a child. The following quote exemplifies the to-date dealings of states and the fed with mining companies: “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” Albert Einstein. How would allowing the spoiling of another of the Earth’s sensitive ecosystems in the name of corporate profits not be “insane”?', 'I writing to call attention to your primary responsibility as elected leaders that you hold in trust the common property shared by the people of Minnesota. It is your duty to use scientific information to disallow pollution, resource destruction, chemical introduction and other harm to our resources. You cannot allow risk to be taken unless and until conclusive proof exists that such practices will not pose harm. Sulfide mining carries tremendous risk to the water and to the people of our state and the continent. The risk is well documented. Those who are in control of the corporations you are speaking with today are such people as Tony Hayward upon who’s watch the gulf was harmed profoundly by Deep Water Horizon. You are allowing corporations like Antofogasta and Glencore with histories of grave pollution and abuse, of workers, to set up camp in Minnesota to the detriment of the people. While this will put money in the pockets of lawyers and a small host of other people, the people this will take money from will have scant share in the profits and would not want it at the real cost it comes at. We citizens quite literally allow you to take food from people’s mouths by permitting mining companies to leak, ooze, pour or gush sulfide and other chemicals into the water. Sulfide interacts with mercury to produce methylmercury, the kind that lingers in the body, literally indefinitely, and harms babies in their mother’s womb. Mercury is a byproduct of mining. Mercury harms neurological development. Presently 1 in 10 babies born on the North Shore of Lake Superior have abnormally high levels of mercury in their bodies at birth. The St Louis River has such high levels of mercury at present that no plan can be formulated to remove it, and make the fish safe to eat. The levels of mercury in the fish are such that those in our state who seek to sustain their lives eating the fish cannot do so. Half a billion dollars have been spent of the people’s tax money to clean the waste that mining has heftily contributed to in the St Louis River, and still it remains polluted beyond health. It is further endangered now by plans for sulfide mining in the Duluth Complex which stretches from north of Ely to south of Aitkin. We have treaties with tribes that we must honor, that grant them the right to hunt and to fish. If we render the fish inedible we dishonor and eviscerate that treaty. We would like to protect fishing, wild rice harvesting and farming for all citizens of Minnesota and surrounding areas of the Midwest. I ask you to honor the responsibility you have to the people now and in the future. We are being put at risk by decisions to allow risk to our water from Sulfide Mining in the Northeast of Minnesota. Lake Superior holds 1/10th of the nation’s fresh surface water and every person on the continent has a right to that water. It is not something the people can allow you, as the trustees of our lands and water and air, to permit it to be destroyed. We ask that until such time as there is a means to extract the disseminated body of minerals without risk to the water; that you not allow it. Please, uphold your duty to the people to hold their lands in safe trust, with the gravity due, to that duty.']"

The present approach is to delay the reactions and store the reactive hazardous producing material in containment structures that can leak, and push treatment of toxic reaction products into long-lasting future care, requiring constant monitoring at greater expense, and creating a threat of probable damage to future aquatic resources. By speeding up the reactions of sulfide to creating sulfate, the acid can be neutralized and the resultant waste products, such a gypsum, might be recoverable and converted into a useful products, assuming the acidic and toxic components are removed. The amounts of sulfide to be mined are fairly well determined and no less than 1.5 pounds of sulfate will be produced for every pound of copper extracted, as a minimum. And more likely, up to ten pounds of sulfate will be produced for every pound of copper extracted, if solids are left mainly to convert to sulfuric acid over the long term. This will result in a Additional Alternatives to the permanent storage of all reactive sulfide-containing ores and related solid materials should be given to being stored in containment structures that do not leak water under any circumstances. The proposed mine pits are not leak-proof structures and are expected to allow some flow of groundwater, at will, regardless of the wishes of the owners. Existing pit lakes show direct water flow connections to ground water aquifers out to several thousand feet. The thousands of blasts of explosives used to pulverize the ore body will surely cause structural damage to the adjoining, adjacent rock structures making up the mine pit walls. Then add air and water exposure, and freeze-thaw cycles for the number of years planned before being filled with waste rock, soil, and finally water. In addition, the numbers of drill holes used to sample the ore body will surely also facilitate the movement of groundwater through the mine pit walls and adjacent areas allowing the flow of ground water to be in contact with the reactive sulfide in the pit walls, and waste rock; all to be flushed out by gw flows into the adjoining watersheds, i.e., the Partridge and Embarrass Rivers. This is one of the major flaws in the approach to permanently store the reactive sulfides in mine pit lakes where it is not possible to control gw water flows.', 'As stated in section (pg 3-37): covering acid-forming sulfide-containing ore and waste rock with two feet of soil and vegetated according to Minnesota Rules, parts 6132.2700 and 6132.3200 is not an acceptable treatment for reactive, acid- forming sulfide-containing ore and waste rock and will lead to acid and metal contaminated surface and ground water runoff, and eventually led to acid and metal polluted streams and lakes. These reactive mine wastes must be properly contained and treated to mitigate any remaining reactivity as indicated by the presence of sulfide-containing materials and comply with the specific provisions of M.R. 6132.2200 for reactive mine waste. Measurements of total sulfide, and correlations with measurements of chemical oxygen demand (COD) are absent and would be useful in determining the total quantities of oxygen capable of reacting with atmospheric oxygen for the different categories of ore, waste rock, and mine tailings as a function of particle size and condition. This information should be generated, evaluated and added to the final EIS.', 'All sulfide-containing mined rock, ore, and sulfide-containing material is capable of reacting (Piles 1 - 4) with atmospheric oxygen and results in generating toxic sulfuric acid which then absorbs water from the air, mobilizes and transport toxic metal concentrations, and causes groundwater and surface water pollution. Data are absent for measured reactivity and predicted acid formation as functions of times of extraction, particle size, and exposure to various concentrations of oxygen in air vs. depth of cover and precipitation. The entire mining site can become a toxic acid-toxic metal solution generator where ever sulfide containing materials are deposited when mined, transported, handled, crushed, stored, processed, shipped, and their resulting wastes are finally disposed of. Long times of reaction will result in toxic acid and toxic metal solutions being generated over decades of time from when these reactive sulfide-containing minerals, ores, and wastes are exposed to atmospheric oxygen, extracted by precipitation, resultant runoff and groundwater displacement. Mine disposed of mineral extraction wastes in semi-pervious cells, build upon and within leaky iron-ore tailings basins are unacceptable and do not meet the specific requirements described in Minn. Rule 6132.2200 for REACTIVE MINE WASTES. Contaminated water collection systems must be put in place and all runoff water collected and treated at the WWTF for completion of mine waste reaction times to consume all reactive sulfide present, probably several decades into the future, post-closure.

There have been indications that PolyMet that in late 2004 was a dormant penny stock was resurrected as an insider scheme to enrich government officials and others. Present and past subsidies to PolyMet including public historical public ownership to allow PolyMet to avoid paying past property taxes, the Minnesota policy (which exists in no other state)to server mineral interests which devalues land and passes the tax burden of land ownership and cost of government services off on non-mining supported businesses, drilling subsidies paid for by the state of Minnesota, millions of dollars of public money not fully publicly disclosed by the IRRRB granted directly to PolyMet, the failure to adequately and in advance require financial assurance and the pollution subsidy which will destroy other valuable public resources and cause other businesses and the public to subsidize PolyMet with higher health care costs, the diminution or public recreational and tourism opportunities, etc, all contribute to a violation of the National Land Management Policy Act. St. Louis County alone has 940,000 acres of tax forfeited land, the shattering of the hopes and dreams of thousands of land owners, hundreds of them farm owners and business supporters of agriculture.', 'As I’ve listened to individuals speak up on both sides of this issue, I noticed a few things. The large majority of those in favor of this PolyMet project are not giving any substantial proof or evidence to discount items raised by those against it. I have not heard any quality, educated honest truth to prove the opposing side wrong. Those in favor of this project are driven by money. It doesn’t matter what kind of mining it would be, they just want more jobs. There are no jobs being taken away from anyone – no one is being laid off their job here. This project would just be creating brand new jobs – and as PolyMet has stated it would create ~300 jobs (as a guess). Those guesstimated ~300 jobs would not necessarily be given to people from the Iron Range or Minnesota. PolyMet is an international business, so it is very possible that people they hire will not be from Minnesota. Another point that many people have already stated is that the project would be for ~20 years (also a guesstimate). Only 20 years. That certainly goes by very fast. Twenty years ago it was 1994 – that wasn’t that long ago. Another hap-hazard statement was made in the late 1800’s. A politician was quoted in saying that there was enough old- growth timber across the U.S. that it would take a century just to make a dent in it. In less than 20 years, the old-growth timber was cut down. That was devastating and we are now repairing it by replanting as we have learned about conservation practices. Sulfide mining is not repairable. It is traumatic and its’ damages/death last forever. PolyMet says it will take 500 years to clean up. I can’t seem to comprehend why “we” are even discussing this project with them, with their incomprehensible and irrational data. Again, PolyMet is making a guesstimate...500 years to clean up. I would think that with that number, PolyMet either... 1)has no idea how long it would take to clean up, but they know this is highly toxic so it certainly will take a long time...2)they really know it would never be able to be cleaned up but instead of saying “Never or Forever”, they just threw out a big number instead...3)they don’t care what number they say because they aren’t going to clean it up and why would they, it’s not even their country to care about. And what company would even last 500 years, let alone follow through with their clean-up in a foreign country in which they only got 20 years of product out of? It’s very rare that you hear of companies that are 100 years old. Researching this PolyMet company shows that they are not trustworthy, unethical, and have no concern for the land, water, and people (and workers) who live, work, and recreate in the area they are after. Those in favor of this sulfide mine are seeing dollar signs or at least hope to. But, it doesn’t matter what kind of mining it is, they just want more work/more money. There is a waxing and waning with many professions and skills, and if the people who are living on the Iron Range are not willing to move to a different location to find it (which is what many people have to do in order to find work), then a new type of profession/skill needs to be created in that area – however, jobs such as; drug dealers, prostitution, cock-fighting, the mafia, and sulfide mining are not ethical and all of them damage the overall well-being of the greater biotic community, environmentally and socially. The only reasoning behind any support for this mine comes from people wanting jobs in one area of the state that sees waxing and waning from any type of mining operation. The destruction that this type of mining would be irreversible and any local people who might get one of the few jobs created by this mine would likely end up with severe health problems and live in an undesirable environment. The new wave of the future rests on renewable and sustainable. Why not bring in jobs to the Iron Range area that would be on the leading edge of those green industries?']"

The PolyMet FEIS is adequate under federal and state laws and regulations because: - It evaluated pollution risks to drinking water, fish, wild rice and human health using realistic assumptions about how much polluted seepage will be captured and treated during operations, reclamation, and closure. - It analyzed health risks and impacts on children, workers and communities who rely on fish and wild rice for subsistence, including risks from asbestos-like particles and methylmercury. - It evaluated the impacts of polluted seepage north of the mine site on the 100 Mile Swamp and the Rainy River (Boundary Waters area) Basin. - It adequately considered alternatives to minimize environmental harm, reduce polluted seepage from unlined permanent waste facilities, mitigate wetlands destruction, and reduce the threat of catastrophic dam failure.

This is no different than what is done for every modern industrial mine around the world indeed it is legally required in virtually any jurisdiction. Each mine plan is designed to address the particular difficulties of the site, the ore body, and the mining and processing methods. The FEIS presents the NorthMet mine plan as though it identifies the perfect engineered systems that will result in a mine with no accidents, no failures, and no errors in the systems as designed, installed, or maintained. Mining companies throughout history have laid out plans to minimize environmental impacts. And yet significant environmental impacts often occur, as demonstrated in recent global mining catastrophes highlighted in the media. Given the size of the proposed mine and its location in one of the wettest parts of the United States, concern for accidents, failures, and unforeseen design, installation, and maintenance errors should be heightened rather than dismissed. NEPA requires that to the extent that errors, accidents, and failures are reasonably foreseeable over the expected life of the project (i.e., more than five hundred years), the potential impacts must be disclosed in the FEIS. The FEIS completely fails to meet this requirement. This shortcoming affects virtually every aspect of the mine plan and the FEIS. It was raised generally and in relation to several specific mine features in our comments on the SDEIS at MCEA 3, 5–6, 22, 40–54 Friends 1–8, 32–37, 39– 40 CBD 33–45, 57–59 and in our supplemental letter on the Mt. Polley tailings basin disaster in British Columbia. All of these materials along with exhibits cited therein are incorporated herein. The legal requirement begins with the most elementary aspect of NEPA review an EIS must disclose all reasonably foreseeable significant impacts of a proposed project. Both the CEQ and the courts recognize that this involves some conjecture in many situations, whether or not a particular impact will occur cannot be known with any certainty at the time an EIS is prepared. But this does not allow an agency to ignore the possibility of impacts. In the face of uncertainty, an agency must provide a scientifically defensible assessment of the likelihood of the impact’s occurrence, and a discussion of the potential effects commensurate with the likelihood and severity of those effects.105 In a situation where errors, accidents, and failures could result in significant impacts, “[t]hat circumstance obliges the agency to undertake risk assessment an estimate of both the consequences that might occur and the probability of their occurrence.” While “NEPA does not require consideration of risks that are ‘merely speculative’ or ‘infinitesimal,’” it also does not allow an agency to ignore risks based on unsupported assumptions that errors, accidents, and failures will not occur. To use waste storage facilities as an example, the FEIS Response to Comments Theme GT 15 acknowledges that “If incorrectly designed, constructed or managed, or from other unforeseen circumstances, waste material storage facilities would have the potential to result in increased hydrologic and/or water quality effects and could potentially lead to slope or dam failure.” Pursuant to NEPA, this acknowledged fact necessitates a risk assessment addressing “an estimate of both the consequences that might occur and the probability of their occurrence.” In the NorthMet FEIS, however “hypothetical failure scenarios are not assessed,” apparently because the Co-Lead Agencies believe that “design and safety requirements, including adaptive management procedures” will work perfectly for hundreds of years.109 Theme WR 129 makes the statement “With appropriate monitoring and pre-planned contingency actions, and adequate financial assurance, it is technically feasible to maintain the operation of engineered systems indefinitely into the future.” Unfortunately, technical feasibility has never been enough to prevent accidents and failures. And history is replete with engineered systems that theoretically should have worked perfectly, but nonetheless eventually revealed that the engineers who designed them or the workers who built and maintained them were not themselves infallible, not to mention myriad external forces beyond human control. Human Error It is often noted that while the safety and reliability of engineered systems in-and-of-themselves continues to improve over time, the propensity for human error does not. Across numerous industries, the percentage of errors caused by human error is estimated at about 80 percent. Thus despite the technological advances that have been made in aviation, maritime shipping, medicine, IT, and many other industries, accident and failure rates decrease far more slowly than would be expected given improvements in technology. In a study of “operation events” that represented some sort of operations failure at nuclear power plants, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission made the following observations 1. Human error contributed significantly to risk in nearly all events analyzed. Forty-one percent of events involved partial or complete loss of either onsite or offsite power, 22 percent involved loss of Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) and 19 percent involved loss of feedwater. . . . The average human error contribution to the change in risk was 62 percent. 2. Latent errors were present in every event analyzed and were more predominant than active errors by a ratio of 4 to 1. Latent errors were noted in all facets of performance studied, including operations, design and design change work practices, maintenance practices and maintenance work controls, procedures and procedure development, corrective action program, and management supervision. . . . 3. Without exception, the operating events analyzed included multiple contributing factors. On the average, the thirty-seven events contained four or more human errors in combination with hardware failures. Fifty percent of events contained five or more errors. Many events contained between six and eight human errors. 4. Human errors can result in the failure or increased likelihood of failure of risk-significant equipment. For a sample of ten events with the highest event importance, human error was determined to contribute to component failure. There were three events where a single human error contributed to a single PRA [Probabilistic Risk Assessment] basic event, and seven events where multiple human errors contributed to multiple PRA basic events. . . . 5. Design and design change work practice errors were present in 81 percent of events, maintenance practices and maintenance work control errors were present in 76 percent of events, and operations errors were present in 54 percent of events. Additionally, more maintenance and operations errors mapped to basic events in the PRA model than did design and design change errors. 6.

At the P90 level, reject concentrate would contain: 1,150 μg/L of arsenic (2 μg/L criterion for drinking water); 16,600 μg/L of manganese (100 μg/L HRL for drinking water); 847 of cobalt (5 μg/L surface water limit); 11,600 μg/L of copper (9.3 μg/L limit in water with 100 mg/L hardness); 1,290 μg/L of lead (3.2 μg/L limit in water with 100 mg/L hardness); 8,230 mg/L of sulfate (10 mg/L limit in wild rice waters). (Water Modeling Data Package – Mine Site, PolyMet 2015m, autop. 452). As described previously in Section IV of these comments, the NorthMet hydrometallurgical residue facility would be located adjacent to a source of seepage with the potential to build up flow beneath its liner and on top of an LTVSMC emergency basin containing as much as 50 feet of fine tailings and slimes, which was sited on top of wetlands and a fault line and constructed using an upstream construction method. (FEIS, 4-439) The FEIS contemplates that “liquefaction of the hydrometallurgical residue” may occur, but states that the embankment dam is “sufficiently designed so that containment would not be lost.” (FEIS, 5-664). The probability of containment failure at the hydrometallurgical residue facility may be low. But the consequences of releasing thousands of pounds of mercury as well as sulfates and other toxic metals could be catastrophic.', 'There is insufficient information revealed in the FEIS to clearly understand the chemical composition of the HRF waste material, and unreasonable assumptions of liner leakage and performance. And as presented in the FEIS, there are two new sources of contaminants planned for disposal in the HRF: water treatment plant solids (primarily gypsum), and coal ash wastes from the existing LTVSMC site Coal Ash Landfill, one of the previously identified AOCs subject to the Consent Decree. These new, potentially toxic and reactive wastes may represent up to 10% of the HRF solids volume155, yet there is no characterization of the mass or concentration of chemicals resulting from the co-disposal of these wastes with the Hydrometallurgical process wastes. The FEIS, instead of providing this analysis up front, states that if the Project is approved, the residue should then be tested to verify that it is not hazardous.156', 'WaterLegacy’s comments on the SDEIS reflected our concern that the hydrometallurgical residue facility (HRF) would contain some of the most concentrated and toxic wastes produced by the PolyMet NorthMet project. Yet, the SDEIS failed to disclose the chemical composition of the HRF wastes and failed to disclose the seepage rate under various reasonable assumptions of liner leakage. Instead, without providing any information from which it could be verified that this conclusion was reasonable, the SDEIS determined that any leakage from the HRF could be ignored and need not be modeled to evaluate environmental impacts. The FEIS does not address WaterLegacy’s prior concerns. The FEIS provides no information regarding the chemical composition of the 313,000 tons per year of HRF waste expected to be produced by autoclave processing of metals at the Hydrometallurgical Plant. Since the SDEIS was prepared, the FEIS has proposed two additional sources of contamination to the HRF waste facility. Water treatment plans solids, primarily gypsum, and coal ash wastes from the existing LTVSMC site Coal Ash Landfill are proposed to be located with the HRF wastes. (FEIS, 5-178, PolyMet 2014c). These additional and potentially toxic and reactive wastes may represent up to 10 percent of the HRF facility solids volume. (FEIS, 4-445). As with the residue from the Hydrometallurgical Plant, the FEIS provides no characterization of the mass or concentration of chemicals resulting from disposal of gypsum and coal ash wastes.']"
26,37,26_mercury_basin_tailings_ng,"['mercury', 'basin', 'tailings', 'ng', 'data', 'seepage', 'feis', 'discharges', 'in', 'sd004']","['The Tailings Basin has four active NPDES monitoring locations that are positioned to intercept Tailings Basin seepage. NorthMet documents state that these monitoring locations provide the best data for determining Tailings Basin discharges. Inexplicably, the FEIS relies almost exclusively only on data from one of these discharge locations – the one that appears to show seepage below 1.3 ng/L. All three of the other discharge locations, including one that is better positioned relative to the likely flow of NorthMet discharges, were essentially ignored. The result is an improperly skewed assessment that mercury levels will be lower than 1.3 ng/L. Correction of this error shows mercury discharges above 1.3 ng/L. 2. Looking beyond NPDES monitoring sites, a comprehensive review of mercury seepage data collected over time at the Tailings Basin also shows that Tailings Basin seepage will exceed Great Lakes Initiative mercury levels of 1.3 ng/L. Despite the availability of this information, it is essentially ignored in the FEIS.', 'Next, the FEIS mischaracterized applicable data to claim that mercury in tailings would be adsorbed to tailings. Discrepancies between claims in the PolyMet NorthMet SDEIS regarding mercury and mercury data in underlying documents were not resolved in the FEIS. The FEIS goes even further than the SDEIS in asserting “the ability of NorthMet tailings to adsorb mercury, in combination with the proven ability of the underlying taconite tailings to adsorb mercury, is expected to result in an overall increase in the adsorption of mercury and subsequent lower concentrations of mercury at the Tailings Basin with the addition of the NorthMet tailings,” (FEIS, 5-229). As explained in WaterLegacy’s SDEIS comments, this optimistic claim mischaracterizes the NTS bench study cited in the FEIS. The FEIS reports that the 2006 NTS bench study reduced mercury concentrations by 73 percent (from 3.3 ng/L to 0.9 ng/L) after 480 minutes. And, as in the SDEIS, the FEIS fails to disclose either that the plain water in a control flask reduced mercury concentrations by 22 percent in that timeframe or that the trend in the experiment, when it was discontinued after eight hours, was that the mercury was desorbing from the tailings and may have doubled since the fourth hour of the experiment when mercury was beneath the detection limit of 0.5 ng/L (FEIS reference Barr 2007d, autop. 157, 160).4 Even more problematic, the FEIS’ assertion that adsorption of mercury by the existing LTVSMC tailings has been “proven” is inconsistent with the data and assertions in Section 4.0 of the FEIS itself. The FEIS states, Comparing the existing Cell 2E pond water quality with water quality at the toe of the Tailings Basin can define the effect that passage through the existing LTVSMC tailings has on seepage water quality. Such comparison shows that passage through the LTVSMC tailings apparently reduces the average concentrations of arsenic, fluoride, and molybdenum, although it is difficult to determine to what extent these reductions are simply attributable to the effects of dilution. The concentrations of several other parameters, such as calcium, manganese, nickel, and TDS, increase as they seep from the tailings pond to the toe of the Tailings Basin. (FEIS, 4-127) The FEIS narrative does not state how mercury concentrations are affected as they pass through the existing LTVSMC tailings, but the data is clear. Mercury in the existing Cell 2E pond has a mean concentration of 1.4 ng/L. Mercury in the toe of the existing tailings facility has a mean concentration of 4.9 ng/L (FEIS, 4-126, Table 4.2.2-23) Using simple arithmetic, the FEIS has proved that in passing through the existing LTVSMC tailings mean mercury more than triples.', 'The NorthMet Tailings Basin assessment improperly underestimates mercury discharges by disregarding data from three out of four of the NPDES monitored surface discharge locations at the Tailings Basin. In addition to the erroneous calculation with regard to water quality at numerous Tailings Basin locations, the FEIS has improperly selected a subset of NPDES water sampling locations that has also resulted in a meaningfully inaccurate assessment of current conditions at the Tailings Basin. The Tailings Basin has four active seeps that have been monitored since the closing of the LTV plant site. In the PolyMet water quality analysis, which is an appendix to the FEIS, PolyMet’s water quality scientists state that “NPDES surface discharges from the Tailings Basin serve as the best proxy for concentrations of mercury seepage from the existing Tailings Basin”. PolyMet 2013j at page 271. SD006 is in the southeast corner of the Tailings Basin, SD001, SD004, and SD005 are in the northwest corner of the Tailings Basin; and SD002 is in the north central portion of the Tailings Basin. There was apparently never an SD003, so there is no data. Also, SD005 has essentially been dry and not sampled for most of the last 13 years. That leaves four NPDES sample locations to review: SD001, SD002, SD004, and SD006 consistent with the opinion of PolyMet’s water model that these discharges are the best proxy for concentrations of mercury seepage from the existing Tailings Basin”. Despite the fact that this seepage data is so critical to assessing mercury contamination, only Tailing Basin data from SD004 is used to support the determination that mercury levels will be below Great Lakes levels. This was a clear error in the SDEIS, and the error has been carried forward in the FEIS. SD0026, which is at the plant site and not the Tailings Basin, is also used, but it gives no indication of likely Tailings Basin discharges. In fact, it is not located in the Embarrass River watershed like the Tailings Basin. In order to evaluate whether this single sampling point should be the primary empirical assessment of groundwater conditions, I obtained NPDES sampling data from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for all four of the Tailings Basin NPDES surface discharges. I then evaluated total mercury in the Tailings Basin for each of these sample locations, but with more up to date information through 2006 to be consistent with most FEIS data sets. Based upon this MPCA data, I calculated total mercury levels for each of the four NPDES locations, plus average of all samples regardless of which location was sampled (basically a weighted average), and further an average of the four sites (basically a weighted average). My spreadsheets with calculations are available upon request, but should be easily reproducible without them because the data is readily available from the MPCA. My results are provided graphically below, and are also summarized in the accompanying table. The graph indicates that rather than SD004 being a representative sample of conditions at the NorthMet Tailings basin, SD004 is an outlier – the one location that isn’t above the Great Lakes standard of 1.3 ng/L. All three of the other locations were above Great Lakes standards, as were averages weighted by sample number and location.']"

In the Partridge River, the 2009 survey identified rice near SW-004b, also upstream of the proposed compliance point. Barr Engineering conducted the survey and has indicated a possible error in the 2009 survey, bringing into question the accuracy of these upstream wild rice locations in the Partridge River. Currently, the wild rice water quality standard is not being met in portions of the Embarrass and Partridge river systems. The FEIS states that the wild rice sulfate standard would be met for the Embarrass River, assuming the containment and seepage collection system would capture seepage presently going to the Embarrass tributaries. However, the Partridge River will exceed the standard during low-flow conditions. We question how this will be handled in permitting.', 'Wild Rice as a species of Special Concern in Minnesota. Although the quality and diversity of our natural wild rice (Zizania aquatica) stands have deteriorated over the past 60 years, wild rice has not been mentioned as a species of concern. While sulfate connections to the deterioration of the wild rice crop are being studied, we believe that wild rice should be designated a Species of Concern, giving the DNR the ability to protect this species from mining expansion and to require industries to clean up their pollution. Wild rice, or manomin, is the official state grain of Minnesota and deserves our protection. Wild rice is the canary in the coal (or taconite) mine. The loss and/or degradation of vital wild rice stands in northeast Minnesota is a warning sign that something must be done in order to protect the quality of our waters.', 'The information in the FEIS on Wild Rice is inadequate. GLIFWC staff have submitted comments on the deficiencies in wild rice analysis in every previous version of the FEIS yet the issues remain. We are aware of the MPCA determination on waters that are defined as supporting the production of wild rice. We believe that the process used to inform this determination must incorporate historic information of wild rice presence, abundance and habitat. The following section provides historic information on wild rice that, when viewed in combination with other more recent information, suggests that the Embarrass River produces or has produced wild rice in several areas upstream of the current point of compliance. Therefore, we suggest that the compliance point for the wild rice sulfate standard should be upstream of the current location at all areas where rice is growing. Manoomin or Wild Rice can be found throughout the Great Lakes but the areas of greatest concentration are in Minnesota and Wisconsin (Peter David, GLIFWC wild rice biologist, personal communication, Jenks 1901, Moyle 1944, MRC 1969). The areas of greatest concentration, which are defined as wild rice districts by Jenks, encompass lakes and streams within the region covered by glacial outwash. Jenks’ description of the wild rice district is often cited in other publications that describe the range of wild rice (GLIFWC, 1999). Jenks provides additional information on wild rice distribution by stating that within the wild rice district, rice is found wherever there is suitable habitat. Specifically: “Farther south the St. Louis River system tells the same tale – the streams all bear abundant stores of wild rice” (Jenks, 1901, page 1035) This publication supports the accounts of tribal members from the tribes acting as cooperating agencies for this project. The draft Cultural Landscape Report prepared as part of the Polymet SDEIS dated September 15, 2011 states, “With the potential for wild rice in the shallow margins of lakes and streams, and abundant wild plant, fishing and hunting habitats, portions of the Preliminary Project APE may have been very attractive to the Ojibwe” (pg. 48). That report also includes an account from a Bois Forte tribal member indicating that harvest occurred on the Embarrass River. Another tribal member stated that she knows of a family that harvested wild rice in the vicinity of the LTV tailings dam on the Embarrass River. These specific descriptions would indicate harvest occurring upstream of Embarrass Lake and upstream of Wynne and Sabin Lakes. This supports the notion of abundant wild rice stands in areas where only smaller stands now remain. Another corroborating piece of information is the presence of a wild rice farm straddling the Embarrass River. This wild rice farm operated from 1957 until 1993 when the operation went bankrupt (Barr, 1995). Aerial Photos taken in the spring of 1991 and 1992 show the flooded rice paddies and some ditches connecting the farm to the Embarrass River. The use of water from the river in the farm operation clearly defines the Embarrass River as used for the production of wild rice. In addition Unnamed Creek was likely a source of water for the farm. This creek currently originates at the northwest corner of the LTV tailings basin. According to the Clean Water Act (CWA) this use of water for production of wild rice is a designated use. As such, the sulfate standard applies for the Embarrass River. Field data collected by Barr Engineering (Barr, 2011) indicates that mine related sulfate effluent has already impacted the river to the point of exceeding the wild rice standard. The Draft Staff Recommendation does not provide information on how the MPCA considered the existing water quality in its recommendation and to what extent the high sulfate values have already impacted wild rice on the Embarrass River. This basic analysis should be part of describing existing conditions in the FEIS. A description of how the issues of wild rice habitat protection and existing elevated sulfate levels in the Embarrass River water were treated in the development of the recommendation is needed. Wild rice in this area is a degraded resource. As such, all remnant populations are in need of protection. This need is further emphasized by the designation of the Embarrass River as impaired in the 2012 draft 303d list. The current wild rice standard language clearly states that wildlife use of wild rice is an important factor in protecting the plant. It is not clear how MPCA staff determined that the number of wild rice plants upstream of the current point of compliance is not enough to be used as a food source by wildlife. GLIFWC staff is not aware of research that defines the number of plants or the density of a rice bed that would make it usable to blackbirds, muskrat, geese, or other wildlife. A single plant can provide nutrition to wildlife. Furthermore, browsing by wildlife is one of the reasons that wild rice fluctuates in abundance and density from year to year (Peter David, GLIFWC wild rice biologist, personal communication). The variability that is observed in the wild rice survey data on the Embarrass River may well be the result of wildlife use. Finally, Barr Engineering field notes indicate wildlife is using the wild rice stands in the area. These observations of browsing include small stands that are classified in the lowest density and lowest abundance categories (Barr, 2013). This supports the tribal position that all locations where rice is growing should be points of compliance for the 10 mg/l sulfate standard. Based on available information the GLIFWC staff believes that productive wild rice waters on the Embarrass River are where wild rice is currently growing and is confirmed to have been present in the past. The basis for this view is: • Wild Rice has been present at these locations during at least one of the five survey years (2009 – 2013). • The wild rice sulfate standard is 10 mg/l. • Wild Rice is food for wildlife regardless of its density and the observed inter annual fluctuation in abundance of wild rice in the Embarrass River is consistent with the ecology of wild rice. Barr field notes support this position. • Historic information from tribal sources indicates past harvest in this area and non-tribal sources support the assertion that this is an area where wild rice was found. • The existence of a rice farm in this area is consistent with the assertion that the Embarrass River water quality was supportive to wild rice prior to mining impacts. • Wild rice in the Embarrass River endures despite degraded water quality. It is likely that the degraded water quality has decreased the abundance of wild rice in this river.']"

This faction would like to keep doing more mining to continue a tradition of mining that began with iron mining in Minnesota. By this logic, mining just continues generation after generation, until at some point the mineral resources just run out. Then, a post-mining economy will be the only choice. In northeastern Minnesota, there is currently a large eco-tourism and vacation economy that would be seriously negatively impacted by mining all resources including throughout the BWCA. Since mining is of dubious profitability for the mining companies and even less like to produce any lasting wealth for Minnesota, Minnesota would be better off in the long term to ban all sulfide mining and make the shift to a post-mining economy now. In this way, the amenity of a pristine wilderness environment can continue to support an eco-tourism and vacation economy in perpetuity - and simultaneously act as a draw for families and workers interested in working in the post-mining economy. This post-mining economy could be characterized by (among other opportunities) small business entrepreneurship making use of high speed data connections to the rest of the world.', ""I feel that mining is shortsighted and betting the farm on a few years if mining over a lifetime of pristine beauty is ridiculous..

Clearly, they have attempted to come up with a plan to mine sulfide minerals in a water--rich region of the earth that would extract the minerals and preserve the environment. However, it has become clear that they have not succeeded. The ore is so lean that massive amounts must be mined exposing large pits and lots of rock with sulfide metal exposures. The need to treat water for centuries is a significant design failure; it is likely to be impossible. The complexities of the flow of water off the site must be addressed. It is another design failure. Protecting the environment while sulfide mining in an area with large amounts of water is known to be extremely difficult – maybe, it has never been done. Several studies of how well mining operation met their water quality prediction have been completed. The results are daunting. Here is a comment on that from the Minesite Drainage Assessment Group (MDAG). (They are also quoted on a different topic in section 5.2.2 of the SDEIS): “Maest et al. (2006a and 2006b) and Kuipers et al. (2006) compiled comparisons of (a) predicted drainage chemistries before mining to (b) measured drainage chemistries after mining started. They found: -- Three--quarters (75%) of mining case studies with close proximities to waters underestimated (underpredicted) drainage chemistry and thus the downstream environmental effects. This was often due to overestimation of the effectiveness of mitigation measures. “ This is a company that has never run a mine, and thus there is no history with which to judge its capabilities. The agencies are exhibiting extreme credulity to expect that the plan for this project will meet its goals and protect Minnesota’s environment. No design or plan for something this complex is perfect, but the idea that we can “adapt” or “improvise” when some very predictable problems occur that were not considered in the FEIS is unacceptable. These situations are likely to compromise water quality or other resources. Please consider that the design of this project is flawed. We are not producing widgets in a manufacturing plant. This mine will operate in the natural environment with water, sun, snow, ice and storms. It is incredibly risky to accept this EIS as being adequate to actually protect those resources. As it stands, the FEIS leaves far too many unanswered questions, and evaluates far too few “what if” scenarios that have a probability of arising. Those minerals should be left in the ground until a company with a proven track record and a proven design and plan can extract them safely.']"

Minnesota Academy of Family Physicians – Lake Superior Chapter (March 9, 2015) “We join our colleagues in the fields of medicine, nursing, and public health as well as our state Health Department to advocate for the health of our region. A health risk assessment and a health impact assessment are the next critical steps in understanding both the short and long term consequences that PolyMet’s NorthMet project may have on our health.” Minnesota Academy of Family Physicians – Statewide Organization (July 1, 2015) ""The Minnesota Academy of Family Physicians (MAFP) is the largest medical specialty organization in Minnesota, representing over 3000 family physicians, family medicine residents, and medical students. . . As physicians, our priorities are the health of our patients and the communities we serve. We must be proactive in asking, “How will PolyMet’s NorthMet Project affect the long-term health of our patients and communities?” Health Risk and Health Impact Assessments are needed to answer these questions.” The PolyMet NorthMet FEIS’ analysis of health risks suffers from the same inadequacies discussed in other sections of these comments. Unsupportable models and unsubstantiated assumptions affect assessment of impacts of surface water and groundwater pollution on human health. The failure to apply Health Risk Limits and Risk Assessment Advice to groundwater further biased FEIS conclusions. The FEIS denial of methylmercury increases and other adverse impacts, results in a failure to evaluate potentially serious threats to human health, particularly to children’s health. It is rare for Minnesota’s rather conservative medical community to be united in their concern. It is not too late to require an independent and rigorous assessment of the adverse health impacts of the PolyMet NorthMet sulfide mine project.']"

The most recent data we have for Silver Bay (F1) and Beaver Bay (F7) is contained on an Excel spreadsheet prepared by MPCA staff and provided to Le Lind on January 24, 2007.523 The average amphibole fiber count in the ambient air in Silver Bay (F1) in 2006 was 4,998 fibers per cubic meter.524 The average amphibole fiber count in the ambient air in Beaver Bay (F7) in 2006 was 5,823 fibers per cubic meter. This translates to 0.0050 fibers per cc in Silver Bay and 0.0058 fibers per cc in Beaver Bay. If these fibers were as toxic as amosite asbestos, this would translate to an increased cancer risk of 12.5 and 14.5 in 10,000. We are also submitting three sampling data sheets for monitoring in Babbitt in 2008.525 One had a result of zero; the average of the other two samples is 8,806 amphibole fibers per cubic meter, or 0.0088 fibers per cc. This would amount to an estimated increased cancer risk of 22 in 10,000 for amosite asbestos. Thus even if the sum of toxicity of fibers from Minnesota mines is only one-tenth the toxicity of amosite asbestos, the ambient air in Minnesota mining communities is already above the EPA benchmark, which is regarded as an indicator of an acceptable level of risk.526 The Minnesota Air Toxics Study published in 2005 reported on monitored levels of listed air toxics between 1996 and 2001. Although the study found that a few substances were present in ambient air at above the benchmark for an additional 1 in 100,000 increased cancer risk, no substance was present above the benchmark for an additional 1 in 10,000 increased cancer risk at any location. This indicates that even if the sum of toxicity of fibers from Minnesota mines is one-hundredth the toxicity of amosite asbestos, it is still one of the most serious air toxics health issues in Minnesota. This situation is allowed to continue in part because the State focuses attention on epidemiological studies in regard to mineral fibers from mining, while for every other toxic substance (and for mineral fibers from any other industry), allowable levels in the ambient air are based on toxicological studies. Limitations based on toxicological studies protect the public at a level that is not measurable in the local population by epidemiological studies. Given the size of the local population, it would be impossible to detect an increase of one additional cancer in 10,000 people on the Iron Range, much less assign a cause. And yet discussions of the toxicity of fibers in the ambient air on the Iron Range and North Shore invariably center on epidemiological studies such as the Minnesota Taconite Workers Study. The NorthMet FEIS repeats this pattern.527 Minnesota agencies apparently will not require that amphibole fibers in the ambient air in Northeastern Minnesota remain below a certain level until the increase in cancer in the general population is measurable, despite the fact that MDH consistently rejects such an approach as insufficiently protective of public health. Standard agency practice for protecting the public from airborne toxins is nowhere to be found in the public discourse.', 'The FEIS does not adequately evaluate the potential effect of the inhalation of asbestos-like fibers generated at the mine site and in the processing plant. Mesothelioma and other lung disease have been diagnosed in studies by the MN Department of Public Health in taconite workers and local residents. The source of these fibers was the Dunka Mine pit and nearby Peter Mitchell Mine pit. Recent MPCA fiber monitoring results show toxic amphibole levels near 12000 fibers per cubic meter. The data was taken on 08/10/2008 in Babbitt, MN which is later than the June 2007 date of the reference document 2007l.RS61 and so was not taken into account in the FEIS reference which makes this reference incomplete at best. The argument that these fibers are cleavage fragments and thus are not harmful has been debunked by many qualitied experts including Steve Ring in his comments on the SDEIS. Phil Cook (recently deceased) of the EPA’s Duluth Water Lab issued extensive research showing that certain types of these fibers, including ferroactinolite, can be up to 20 times more toxic than even the Libby, Montana fibers which are a toxicity standard. The material at the PolyMet NorthMet mine pit would contain these same fibrous materials interspersed with the sulfide ore PM2.5 dust. Both workers and residents would be exposed to this potent combination of fibers and particles entering their lungs. This FEIS does not acknowledge this as being a health problem. Sulfur based oxides combined with iron based fibers in the lungs represents a new unexplored threat to the public health in the area. A health based standard for the permissible density of these fibers and particles in the mine, processing plant and surrounding residential areas must be developed before any permitting of the mine is considered. Even the World Heath Organization recommends no more than 400 particles in the PM2.5 range as a maximum exposure level for the humans. The EPA test data from the Duluth lab clearly shows that even smaller fibers cause tumors and that the toxicity of the fibers is best determined by their surface area, not their length. The PolyMet NorthMet Mine Project FEIS does not adequately describe a project that protects public health from this source of air pollution. The cancers and lung diseases from this type of air pollution do not surface for decades after the exposure. The addition of sulfur compounds to the mix of iron based asbestos-like fibers has not been adequately addressed in this NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange Final Environmental Impact Statement.', 'In the meantime, Phil Cook and a number of researchers studying the fibers that have cost so many lives in Libby, Montana, have set aside the argument over what is and is not “asbestos” or “asbestiform” and have instead looked at toxicity studies of a range of fibers with variable factors such as particle dimensions, mass, shape, surface area, and material type. As some of these researchers point out in a 2011 journal article, “For regulatory and health assessment purposes, it is microscopical morphology that counts: there is no evidence that potentially affected cells can distinguish between ‘asbestiform’ and ‘nonasbestiform’ fibres having the equivalent dimensions.”514 The EPA put together a database of 70 mineral fiber samples used in biological studies and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).515 The database includes fibers from the Peter Mitchell Pit, several types of UICC asbestos fibers, and other mineral fibers not classified as asbestos.516 This work was done in response to the understanding that although non-asbestos fibers (including “cleavage fragments”) may not be as toxic as asbestos, that does not mean that they are benign. As Dr. Roberts pointed out in his report to MDH, The current approach for evaluating risk from airborne asbestos dates back to 1986 and is based upon measurement of fibers of a specified size and aspect ratio (i.e., length-width ratio) using phase contrast microscopy (PCM). There are a number of problems with this approach related to the technology for fiber detection and measurement [PCM], the way in which mineral fibers of interest are defined, and the assumption that a single toxic potency value is adequate to characterize risk from all relevant mineral fiber types. . . . . . Further, there is also concern mineral fibers that pose cancer risk by inhalation may be defined too narrowly, and that a single potency value for asbestos is too simplistic to adequately cover the variety of fiber sources and exposures that exists. Dr. Roberts was tasked with assessing whether the EPA database provided sufficient information to allow estimates of toxicity of a range of mineral fibers, wholly aside from their categorization as “asbestos.” Specifically, Dr. Roberts was asked to answer three questions: 1. Can the available data be used to provide fiber potency estimates? 2. Are available data adequate for dose-response modeling? 3. Is physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PB-PK) modeling feasible? The answer to all three questions was “yes.”518 At the time the report was written (2010), Dr. Roberts noted that although PB-PK modeling was feasible, it did not yet exist, but that it was being developed through the Libby Action Plan and would likely be available in the near future.519 That work has now been done, and was reported on at the Duluth Conference. Thus if the statement in the NorthMet FEIS that “[t]he Co-lead Agencies believe that there is currently incomplete and unavailable scientific information to characterize the health risk to the public from exposure to mineral fibers and that the means to obtain such information are not known” is true, it is only because the agencies have failed to investigate and inform themselves of the current state of the science. At the Duluth Conference, Acting Division Director Dale Hoff presented the late Phil Cook’s work on calculating fiber potency estimates. The framework was to set the toxicity of UICC amosite asbestos at a potency of 1.0, and to estimate the relative potencies of other fibers as indicated by modeling based on the data in the EPA database. To our knowledge this material has not yet been published, but the methodology and database are available. The EPA estimates that 0.0004 UICC amosite asbestos fibers per cubic centimeter in ambient air will result in one additional cancer per 10,000 people.521 While the discussion below relates to cancer risks, non-malignant health risks can be of even greater concern.']"

(FEIS, 5-10). The FEIS, relying exclusively on Barr data, claims that increases in mercury loading in the Embarrass River from 22.3 to 22.5 grams per year loadings would be more than offset by the decrease in mercury loading from 24.2 to 23.0 grams per year in the Partridge River. (FEIS, 5-572, 6-32). As the result of this alleged “net decrease” in mercury loading, the NorthMet project “is not considered to have the potential for cumulative effects on hydrology and water quality in the St. Louis River.” (FEIS, 6-32) As summarized in Section I, supra, mercury expert Dr. Branfireun has carefully analyzed the Barr mercury data used to support the FEIS, and concluded that it does not meet basic scientific standards for analysis, reporting or addressing the margin of error in data collected. (Branfireun, 2105, pp. 2-9). Dr. Branfireun specifically reviewed the “mass balance” model used by Barr and incorporated into the FEIS and concluded that if an analysis of the margin of error in projections of mercury releases had been performed, the FEIS statements of certainty based on grams of mercury “could not be supported.” Thus, Dr. Branfireun explained, “conclusions from this asserted mass balance that the proposed development will not have appreciable impacts on water quality would be similarly unsupported.” (Branfireun, 2015, p. 14).', 'The FEIS still states, “Mercury air emissions and subsequent mercury deposition were not assessed for the Mine Site because potential emissions are less than 1.0 lb/yr,” (FEIS, p. 5- 462). The FEIS does not acknowledge that 1.0 pound per year is equivalent to 453.6 grams per year. This is an astronomical number when compared to the FEIS’ mercury loading offset calculations. If far less than one percent of NorthMet mine site mercury deposition found its way into the Partridge River, the net effect of the NorthMet project, with no other revisions or corrections, would increase mercury loading to the St. Louis River. Similarly, the FEIS failed to address concerns raised by WaterLegacy regarding mercury deposition near the NorthMet plant site. The FEIS cites the PolyMet Project Air Data Package (PolyMet 2015e) as its primary reference on mercury deposition. This PolyMet document states that the plant will emit 4.6 pounds per year of mercury and describes two scenarios for mercury speciation that affect local deposition, since oxidized mercury can “deposit readily” at a local and regional level and that some particle-bound mercury may also be deposited locally (PolyMet 2015e, autop.1042). If only 25% of mercury is elemental, the more conservative assumption, up to 3.68 pounds or 1,669.2 grams of NorthMet plant site mercury emissions may be deposited locally each year, within a 10-kilometer radius of the plant site (Id., Appendix C to Attachment U, p. 2, autop. 1091). PolyMet 2015e and the corresponding section of the FEIS analyze the effects of local plant site mercury deposition on the mercury Hazard Quotient in the Embarrass River chain of lakes. Yet, as with the mine site mercury deposition, the FEIS does not evaluate the effects that even a small fragment of the potentially 1,669.2 grams of mercury locally deposited would have on a mass loading calculation that claims mercury in the Embarrass River will only increase by 0.2 grams per year as a result of the PolyMet NorthMet project.', 'II. Mercury Loadings to the St. Louis River are Likely to Increase as a Result of the NorthMet Project. The FEIS predicts that there will be a small decrease in mercury loadings to the Partridge River and thus an overall net decrease in mercury loadings to the St. Louis River, despite increased mercury loadings to the Embarrass River. In addition to the fact that a “tradeoff” between increased mercury loadings in the Embarrass River and decreased loadings in the Partridge River does not appear to be permittable (as described in Part I, above), critical flaws in the analysis of mercury in the FEIS have led to incorrect conclusions about mercury loadings from the NorthMet Project. It is likely the Project will actually result in a net increase in mercury loadings to the St. Louis River. Numerous critiques of the mercury mass balance analyses were submitted by GLIFWC staff and others as comments on the Project’s SDEIS and PFEIS. None of these concerns were addressed in the FEIS. Therefore, rather than detail each issue here, the main points are summarized. 1. The mass balance is based on flow estimates from flawed hydrologic models. A mass balance, by definition, relies on accurate estimations of concentration and flow. As a result, the accuracy of the predicted mercury loadings from the mass balance analyses is unreliable. See the hydrologic section for detail of the hydrology modeling issues that have been identified. 2. The mass balance at the plant site is dependent upon the assumption that the NorthMet tailings will adsorb mercury in a similar capacity as the existing LTVSMC tailings. This assumption is based on a 2006 bench top study conducted by Northeast Technical Services, Inc. (NTS). Study details can be found in Appendix B of FEIS reference “Barr 2007d.” This study is insufficient to predict the magnitude of mercury adsorption by the NorthMet tailings. The flask test was conducted over only an 8 hour period to model a centuries long process. There was only one sample with no replication and no attempt to mimic in situ conditions. Further, the study results were incorrectly interpreted, stating that after rapid initial adsorption, mercury levels remained stable throughout the experiment. In reality, the mercury concentrations in the water nearly doubled between hours 4 and 8, when the experiment was terminated, increasing from <0.5 to 0.9 ng/L. If this trend continued, the water would exceed the 1.3 ng/L GLI standard for mercury by hour 12.']"

39,27,39_underground_foth_mining_2012,"['underground', 'foth', 'mining', '2012', 'alternative', 'cost', 'ton', '2009', 'costs', 'economic']","['The MNDNR and USACE considered underground mining as an alternative to the proposed open pit(s) for the DEIS in 2009, but eliminated it because it would have had “a significantly reduced rate of operation that would not be considered economically feasible, and, therefore, would not meet the Purpose and Need of the Project.”183 Even though underground mining was reconsidered for the SDEIS, the Co-Lead Agencies did not “exercise a degree of skepticism in dealing with self- serving statements from the prime beneficiary of a project”184 when analyzing this (or any other) alternative. The Project proponent eliminated the alternative based solely on an economic decision that underground mining would not be as profitable as open pit mining. The Co-Leads stated in the SDEIS that “it was not possible to undertake a quantitative, side-by- side assessment of the underground mining alternative.”185 Thereafter, the FEIS concludes an underground mine would have a reduced mining rate and life of mine, employed fewer workers for a shorter period of time, and reduced state and local tax revenues.186 Conversely, although the underground mining alternative would offer environmental benefits, the SDEIS included no economic analysis of those benefits. Still, the Co-Lead Agencies determined that underground mining would result in reduced socioeconomic benefits, and “PolyMet would not move forward with an unprofitable project, thus any potential environmental or socioeconomic benefits associated with this alternative are moot.”187 Although underground mining was considered technically feasible, the Co-Leads further provided that: PolyMet is a private sector and for-profit company, the value of the saleable material would need to provide sufficient income to cover operating cost (which includes, but is not limited to, the cost of mining, processing, transportation, and waste management), capital cost (to build and sustain facilities), an adequate return to investors, reclamation, and closure costs and taxes. Using underground mining would result in most of the NorthMet Deposit left unmined because of its low metal value (i.e., less value than the cost of mining and mineral processing). Other material would have to be left in place for safety reasons, to prevent collapse.188 Therefore: ...the Co-lead Agencies found that while underground mining is technically feasible, available, and would offer significant environmental benefits over the proposed NorthMet Project, it would not be economically feasible and would not meet the Purpose and Need. Since the underground mining alternative would not meet all of the screening criteria, it is not considered to be a reasonable alternative. Therefore, the underground mining alternative was eliminated from further evaluation in the SDEIS.189 An additional purpose for re-assessing the underground mining alternative became known during consultation with the Bands under Section106 of the National Historic Preservation Act: avoidance of adverse impacts to a traditional cultural property, the Lake Vermillion Beaver Bay Trail (“BBLVT”), which transects a portion of the proposed east pit. Even though avoidance is supposed to be the first consideration before mitigation can be considered for cultural resources, this benefit, along with numerous environmental benefits that an underground mine would afford, were not given adequate consideration and the underground mining alternative remains eliminated from consideration in the FEIS. In no way does this constitute an appropriate level of detail. The conclusion that underground mining is not viable, or preferable, remains substantially unjustified, despite repeated requests for further analysis.190 It is not even a sufficient cost-benefit analysis. The CEQ regulations require that, only where a cost-benefit analysis is “relevant to the choice among environmentally different alternatives,” there are a variety of additional requirements, including “analysis of un-quantified environmental impacts, values, and amenities,”191 in addition to other CEQ alternatives rules. Here, the FEIS does not consider the economic impact of perpetual treatment, and the economic analysis provided by the Project proponent summarily concludes that underground mining is “[n]ot economically viable”—while contradictorily claiming that backfilling the west pit would create encumbrances not allowed in their lease due to minerals located below the west pit that can only be accessed through underground mining. This is not the appropriate use of a cost-benefit analysis for purposes of analyzing an EIS alternative. As the Band already argued in the Tribal Position, significant additional study of the underground mining alternative is mandated, and the SDEIS and the FEIS offer no new discussion of the reasons for rejecting the alternative. An appropriate analysis of the economic viability of an underground mine depends on a variety of factors including ore grade, market prices, cost of tailings, and waste rock disposal. In fact, a study of this particular deposit was performed by the prior owner of the site, U.S. Steel, which actually recommended underground mining.193 PolyMet is well aware of this study, given that the company included it in a 2003 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.194 In fact, by examining cross-sections showing the distribution of ore by depth,195 it appears that there are substantial ore reserves at depths that likely could not be accessed by the proposed open-pit mine. The ecological costs of open-pit mining and above-ground disposal of tailings and waste rock are immense— and there are clearly economic considerations that would cut in favor of underground mining. This ecological cost, combined with the most current understanding of deposit ore grades and reasonably possible metals prices, and the costs associated with perpetual treatment and adaptive management concepts should have been evaluated to determine the viability of this alternative.', '3.2.3.4.1 Underground Mining Alternative In all of the EIS versions the alternative of underground mining has been screened and rejected. Underground mining offers a number of environmental benefits, and would conceivably offer a lesser number of jobs for a similar amount of time as the proposed alternative. As noted by GLIFWC in its comments in FEIS Appendix B: The document states that for an alternative to be evaluated it must meet 5 screening criteria: 1. Be technically feasible 2. Be available 3. Offer significant environmental benefits over the proposed project 4. Meet the purpose and need 5. Be economically feasible As GLIFWC points out, all of these criteria can clearly be met, with the exception of the last. The only rationale that is used to eliminate the alternative is economic feasibility. CSP2 has performed its own analysis of the possible underground mining, assuming an underground room & pillar mining cost of $44/ton for backfill, and $39/ton without backfill.1 We disagree with the assumption in AGP 2011 that the recovery rate for room & pillar mining would be limited to 55%. The method can be more flexible than that assumed by AGP. Mining methods tend have site-specific modifications that are made to make the method most flexible and productive at that site.

Tweaking of assumptions for underground mining with backfill, especially of the operating costs, might also make underground mining with backfill potentially profitable. This is reasonable because all of assumptions made for these analyses are very rough, and if nothing else these calculations suggest that a more detailed analysis of underground mining is warranted. It should not be necessary to show that underground mining in profitable in every circumstance, only that it is possible under some reasonable set of conditions, like the economic climate of 2012, which was not ideal, to operate at a profit. It is also relevant to note that in this section it is stated: This alternative would involve mining the NorthMet Deposit as defined by the proposed open pit boundary. (FEIS, p. 3-159) If the phrase “as defined by the proposed open pit boundary” refers to the horizontal and vertical extent of the proposed pit, then a significant part of the ore body is being left out of the potential ore calculations.', '3.2.3.4.1 Underground Mining Alternative In all of the EIS versions the alternative of underground mining has been screened and rejected. Underground mining offers a number of environmental benefits, and would conceivably offer a lesser number of jobs for a similar amount of time as the proposed alternative. As noted by GLIFWC in its comments in FEIS Appendix B: The document states that for an alternative to be evaluated it must meet 5 screening criteria: 1. Be technically feasible 2. Be available 3. Offer significant environmental benefits over the proposed project 4. Meet the purpose and need 5. Be economically feasible As GLIFWC points out, all of these criteria can clearly be met, with the exception of the last. The only rationale that is used to eliminate the alternative is economic feasibility. CSP2 has performed its own analysis of the possible underground mining, assuming an underground room & pillar mining cost of $44/ton for backfill, and $39/ton without backfill.1 We disagree with the assumption in AGP 2011 that the recovery rate for room & pillar mining would be limited to 55%. The method can be more flexible than that assumed by AGP. Mining methods tend have site-specific modifications that are made to make the method most flexible and productive at that site.

We note that the FEIS added an analysis indicating a potential increase in sulfate levels in wetlands from air deposition alone at 1.7 mg/L, after dilution from precipitation. While the FEIS treats this as negligible, it is actually quite a substantial addition to wetland waters. We were unable to find any baseline information about water quality in the wetlands at the NorthMet site, and our understanding is that there is none. The “background” sulfate level in surface water in Minnesota is often estimated at 3.0 mg/L or below; we assume this is an approximate level for wetlands at the mine site at least. If so, increases from air deposition alone would be as high as 50 percent. Although MPCA estimates that any waters with a current sulfate level above 40 mg/L are “high risk” waters for increased mercury methylation, this does not mean that sulfate does not significantly increase methylation of mercury at much lower levels. Increasing sulfates from 3.0 to 4.7 mg/L in wetlands would be expected to significantly increase mercury methylation. Note that even with similarly low levels of sulfates in most northern Minnesota waters, we have a dire situation in regards to mercury in fish tissue. Small increases in both mercury and sulfate in the water of extensive wetland areas are virtually certain to increase mercury methylation, and to lead to increased mercury levels in fish tissue and in fish-eating wildlife. Methylmercury is known to build to high levels in this situation, flushing out to area streams and lakes with snowmelt or floods. This phenomenon is expected to increase in Minnesota with global warming. The increases in mercury and sulfate that can be expected from the proposed project are likely to result in significant impacts, and thus must be properly assessed in the FEIS; monitoring cannot take the place of this assessment.', 'As Dr. Branfireun detailed in his report, the concentration of mercury in fish tissue is not proportional to air deposition. (Branfireun, 2015, pp. 14-15). Sulfate discharge, sulfate air deposition and hydrological changes resulting in the drying and rewetting of wetlands and sediments all contribute to mercury methylation, mobilizing the form of mercury that bioaccumulates in the food chain. (Id., pp. 9-16, 19-27). The wetlands adjacent to the NorthMet project mine site and tailings site are highly methylating environments, and “Even relatively small changes in water table position and wetting and drying frequency in the ombrotrophic wetlands at the NorthMet mine site have the potential to impact sulfate and methylmercury concentrations of receiving waters.” (Id., p. 19). Based on experimental data in similar wetlands, sulfate deposition at the mine site alone could nearly double methylmercury production (1.88 times) in sensitive peatlands. (Id., p. 23). Dr. Branfireun explained the many mechanisms of mercury export from project site wetlands and their transport downstream. (Id., p. 26). He concluded, after the only comprehensive analysis of methylmercury in the entire FEIS record, I reject as unsupported and without scientific justification, any statement or implication in the FEIS that the proposed NorthMet development would not increase risks of methylmercury production and transport in the Partridge and Embarrass River watersheds, particularly in ombrotrophic wetlands near the mine site and wetlands affecting by tailings site seepage collection, changes to hydrology or atmospheric deposition. . . It is my opinion that the NorthMet development could create a substantial risk of ecologically significant increases in water column and fish methylmercury concentrations in downstream waters, including the St. Louis River. (Id., p. 27)', 'impacts of the proposed NorthMet project are considered in the FEIS. (Id., p. 20). The next section of Dr. Branfireun’s opinion recent applied peer-reviewed research to conclude that “stimulation of methylmercury production by the rewetting process is a ubiquitous process” in Minnesota bog-type wetlands and that “we must expect that a significant proportion of bog wetlands that are within the zone of drawdown from the proposed mine development will also exhibit sulfate regeneration and increased export of methylmercury, under natural rewetting cycles as well as storm events.” (Id., pp. 20- 21). Hydrologic changes as a result of drying and rewetting would promote methylation as well as contribute to repeat flushes of methylmercury and inorganic mercury from the proposed unlined mine site storage area. Dewatering of wetlands surrounding the tailings basin through seepage collection and even modest impacts on the water table resulting from dewatering could increase total mercury, methylmercury and sulfate in the Partridge, Embarrass and ultimately, the St. Louis River. (Id., p. 22). Dr. Branfireun applied recent peer-reviewed research to estimate impacts of sulfate deposition in methylation at mine site wetlands. Using background and deposition rates from Barr and PolyMet documents, Dr. Branfireun calculated that the increased sulfate loading resulting from the NorthMet proposal is, in fact 3.76 times background deposition. Based on results in experimental peatlands, he calculated that mercury export from sensitive peatlands near the mine site may increase up to 1.88 times. Given the magnitude of this potential impact, even if less than all sulfur is liberated to the environment as sulfate, there will still be a substantial stimulatory effect on peatland mercury methylation. Effects of sulfate deposition on peatlands will persist to some degree even after loading has ceased.']"

The FEIS does not adequately assess the “no action” alternative. This issue is presented at MCEA 40 and CBD 107–108, which along with cited exhibits and references are incorporated herein. An EIS must include “no action” as one of its alternatives.93 “No action” in situations like the proposed NorthMet mine and land exchange could mean either that the mine would not be permitted or implemented, or that the land exchange would not occur.94 Importantly, when the choice of no action by the lead agencies would result in “predictable actions by others,” this consequence of the no action alternative needs to be considered and included as part of the no action analysis in the FEIS.95 Although the NorthMet FEIS purports to do this, it does not provide adequate information about the environmental conditions that would be expected under the No Action Alternative. This violates 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(b), which requires the FEIS to “devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail including the proposed action so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits.” The FEIS does not contain sufficient detail on the predicted water quality at the Plant Site and in the Embarrass River watershed under the No Action Alternative to allow an evaluation of the comparative merits of the Proposed Action. In fact, the FEIS completely fails to provide any information on the expected water quality at the Plant Site and in the Embarrass River watershed under the No Action Alternative. Instead, the predicted water quality under the Proposed Action is exhaustively compared to a modeled “Continuation of Existing Conditions” (CEC) scenario, which ignores the existing responsible party (Cliffs Erie)’s legal obligation to clean up and manage the site consistent with state and federal environmental laws. In addition to the violation of 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(b), this violates the requirement that the FEIS provide a “hard look” at the impacts of the Proposed Action. By repeatedly comparing the polluting effect of the Proposed Action with an already polluted situation that is presumed to continue (but which in reality would not and could not continue under existing law), the FEIS presents an inaccurate assessment of the impacts of the Proposed Action. Furthermore, the “Existing Conditions” that were modeled by PolyMet and disclosed in the FEIS do not actually reflect currently existing conditions, because Cliffs Erie has already taken steps to address water quality issues at the site as required by a consent decree with MPCA. Cliffs Erie and MPCA entered into a judicially enforceable consent decree in March 2010, with Cliffs Erie agreeing to take corrective actions to resolve “all alleged violations” of its NPDES permits at these locations.96 Pursuant to the consent decree, Cliffs Erie was required to submit “Short-Term Mitigation Evaluation Plans” for each of the three locations.97 Cliffs Erie was also required to submit “detailed Field Studies Plan Outlines” for each location.98 And, “Long-Term Plans” were required to identify mitigation strategies to address elevated concentrations of sulfates and other parameters of concern at each location.99 Each of these corrective actions were required to be approved by MPCA, and would then become “an integral and enforceable part” of the consent decree.100 If Cliffs Erie fails to comply with the consent decree, it is required to pay monetary penalties to MPCA.101 In addition to failing to adequately address and disclose the corrective actions that have already been taken by Cliffs Erie at the LTV sites in its analysis and disclosure of “existing conditions,” the FEIS also fails to assess the additional corrective measures that will continue to be undertaken by Cliffs Erie in the event the no action alternative is chosen. The very purpose of the consent decree is to bring Cliffs Erie into compliance with the NPDES permit requirements at the LTV tailings basin and mine site, along with the Dunka Pit. Cliffs Erie coming into compliance with the Clean Water Act is not only “predictable” and “reasonably foreseeable,” but also legally required under both the consent decree and the Clean Water Act. Thus comparing in the FEIS the proposed action with a no action alternative where pollution would continue indefinitely at the plant site is both inaccurate and unlawful under NEPA.', 'The PolyMet NorthMet FEIS should have compared the impacts of the proposed action on water quality with an appropriate no action baseline. Despite its assertion quoted above, the FEIS has not evaluated the No Action Alternative, let alone done so in detail. After a 250-page chapter analyzing project impacts on water quality, the discussion of the no action alternative is cursory: “Under the NorthMet Project No Action Alternative, the NorthMet Project Proposed Action would not occur and, therefore, the environmental effects associated with the NorthMet Project Proposed Action, as described in Section 5.2.2, would not occur.” (FEIS, 5-253). Under NEPA, a no action alternative must ""provide a baseline against which the action alternative"" is evaluated. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U. S. Dept. of Interior, 623 F.3d 633, 642 (9th Cir. 2010). (Finding BLM’s approval of an EIS arbitrary and capricious due to flawed assumption regarding result of no action alternative). See also Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. BLM, 746 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1090 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (The “no action” alternative is “the standard by which the reader may compare the other alternatives\' beneficial and adverse impacts related to the applicant doing nothing."") Courts “not infrequently find NEPA violations when an agency miscalculates the ‘no build’ baseline or when the baseline assumes the existence of a proposed project.” N. C. Wildlife Fed\'n v. N.C. DOT, 677 F.3d 596, 603 (4th Cir. 2012) (Finding EIS inadequate due to assumptions made in the “no build” data); Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Kempthorne, 520 F.3d 1024, 1037-38 (9th Cir. 2008). In evaluating the critical impacts of the NorthMet project on water quality, the FEIS explicitly compares the effects of the proposed action with a “Continuation of Existing Conditions” (CEC) scenario, rather than a no build baseline. Every table predicting water quality under the proposed action contrasts it with modeling of this CEC. The FEIS concludes that the proposed action would not cause any significant water quality impacts because “the NorthMet Proposed Action concentrations were no higher than concentrations predicted for the Continuation of Existing Conditions scenario.” (FEIS, 5-9). The CEC is not a no action alternative, but a biased construct. It is a scenario that disregards science, regulation and the proponent’s own obligations in order to compare the NorthMet project’s effects on water quality to an artificially elevated prediction of future pollution. The FEIS, in effect, admits as much. “The CEC scenario,” the FEIS explains, “is not synonymous with the No Action Alternative because it does not account for other foreseeable changes within the NorthMet Project area.” (FEIS, 5-254). The FEIS mentions that actions are currently underway to reduce the sulfate load to the Embarrass River from the Cliffs Erie Area 5NW mine pit. (FEIS, 5-253). But the most significant differences between the CEC scenario and a true no build alternative may involve the LTVSMC brownfield site and tailings waste facility where the NorthMet project is proposed. Under a no action alternative, the existing LTVSMC brownfield site “would be reclaimed in accordance with the Cliffs Erie reclamation/closure plan.” (FEIS, ES-49). In addition, under a no action scenario, if the PolyMet NorthMet project were not built, “the water quality of seepage from the existing LTVSMC Tailings Basin would improve over time as a result of natural attenuation and/or possible additional mitigation measures pursuant to the Consent Decree between the MPCA and Cliffs Erie.” (FEIS, 5-470). A baseline for comparing the adverse effects of a project cannot rely on a false assumption that old pollution would remain unabated if a project were not approved. Preserve Our Island v. United States Army Corps of Eng\'rs, 70 ERC (BNA) 1622, slip op. 46-47 (D.C.W. D. Wash. 2009). The no action baseline comparison in an EIS also cannot properly include elements that would not comply with law. Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Kempthorne, 520 F.3d 1024, 1038 (9th Cir. 2008); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U. S. Dept. of Interior, 623 F.3d 633, 642 (9th Cir. 2010); Conservation Northwest v. Rey, 674 F. Supp. 2d 1232, 1245-1246 (D.C. W.D. Wash., 2009). Where an agency has ignored its duty, the result cannot be presented as a fait accompli in the baseline for an EIS. Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Kempthorne, supra, 520 F.3d at 1037-38. The LTVSMC taconite tailings plant has been closed since 2000 when the LTV Steel Mining Company declared bankruptcy. Seepage concentrations are naturally attenuating as a result of precipitation and dilution. Cliffs Erie, L.L.C., which became legally responsible for permit compliance in 2001 when it acquired the LTVSMC property, is under the legal obligation of a 2010 consent decree (attached to WaterLegacy’s SDEIS comments as Exhibit 8) to remediate tailings waste facility pollution. The failure of the LTVSMC tailings facility to control seepage and remediate pollution may, to some degree, be a regulatory lapse45 that cannot be considered as a fait accompli in the baseline for an EIS. In addition, under the terms of its purchase agreement with Cliffs Erie, since 2006 the PolyMet Company has indemnified Cliffs Erie for remediation obligations at the tailings site and is “working closely” with Cliffs to fulfill Cliffs’ legal obligations. (PolyMet 2015 SEC Form 20-F, Exhibit 23, pp. 18-19). It would be an improper use of the concept of “no action” to allow Cliffs’ and PolyMet’s delay in taking action to remediate tailings basin seepage to distort the baseline for determining the effects of future sulfide mine pollution. This is not an academic question. As discussed in Section I on mercury, the FEIS claims the PolyMet NorthMet project would reduce CEC modeled sulfate loads to the Embarrass River, at least under the FEIS’ assumption of nearly perfect seepage collection. But, if the NorthMet project’s sulfide tailings seepage were compared with a “no action” baseline, including attenuation and remediation under the consent decree, this evaluation could show the NorthMet action increases rather than decreases sulfate and other pollutants. The FEIS doesn’t even allow an answer to the most basic question – Would sulfate pollution be better or worse if the PolyMet NorthMet project were built? On water quality issues, the FEIS does not allow a fair comparison of environmental outcomes between the proposed action and the no build alternative.', 'The PolyMet NorthMet FEIS should have compared the impacts of the proposed action on water quality with an appropriate no action baseline. Despite its assertion quoted above, the FEIS has not evaluated the No Action Alternative, let alone done so in detail. After a 250-page chapter analyzing project impacts on water quality, the discussion of the no action alternative is cursory: “Under the NorthMet Project No Action Alternative, the NorthMet Project Proposed Action would not occur and, therefore, the environmental effects associated with the NorthMet Project Proposed Action, as described in Section 5.2.2, would not occur.” (FEIS, 5-253). Under NEPA, a no action alternative must ""provide a baseline against which the action alternative"" is evaluated. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U. S. Dept. of Interior, 623 F.3d 633, 642 (9th Cir. 2010). (Finding BLM’s approval of an EIS arbitrary and capricious due to flawed assumption regarding result of no action alternative). See also Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. BLM, 746 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1090 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (The “no action” alternative is “the standard by which the reader may compare the other alternatives\' beneficial and adverse impacts related to the applicant doing nothing."") Courts “not infrequently find NEPA violations when an agency miscalculates the ‘no build’ baseline or when the baseline assumes the existence of a proposed project.” N. C. Wildlife Fed\'n v. N.C. DOT, 677 F.3d 596, 603 (4th Cir. 2012) (Finding EIS inadequate due to assumptions made in the “no build” data); Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Kempthorne, 520 F.3d 1024, 1037-38 (9th Cir. 2008). In evaluating the critical impacts of the NorthMet project on water quality, the FEIS explicitly compares the effects of the proposed action with a “Continuation of Existing Conditions” (CEC) scenario, rather than a no build baseline. Every table predicting water quality under the proposed action contrasts it with modeling of this CEC. The FEIS concludes that the proposed action would not cause any significant water quality impacts because “the NorthMet Proposed Action concentrations were no higher than concentrations predicted for the Continuation of Existing Conditions scenario.” (FEIS, 5-9). The CEC is not a no action alternative, but a biased construct. It is a scenario that disregards science, regulation and the proponent’s own obligations in order to compare the NorthMet project’s effects on water quality to an artificially elevated prediction of future pollution. The FEIS, in effect, admits as much. “The CEC scenario,” the FEIS explains, “is not synonymous with the No Action Alternative because it does not account for other foreseeable changes within the NorthMet Project area.” (FEIS, 5-254). The FEIS mentions that actions are currently underway to reduce the sulfate load to the Embarrass River from the Cliffs Erie Area 5NW mine pit. (FEIS, 5-253). But the most significant differences between the CEC scenario and a true no build alternative may involve the LTVSMC brownfield site and tailings waste facility where the NorthMet project is proposed. Under a no action alternative, the existing LTVSMC brownfield site “would be reclaimed in accordance with the Cliffs Erie reclamation/closure plan.” (FEIS, ES-49). In addition, under a no action scenario, if the PolyMet NorthMet project were not built, “the water quality of seepage from the existing LTVSMC Tailings Basin would improve over time as a result of natural attenuation and/or possible additional mitigation measures pursuant to the Consent Decree between the MPCA and Cliffs Erie.” (FEIS, 5-470). A baseline for comparing the adverse effects of a project cannot rely on a false assumption that old pollution would remain unabated if a project were not approved. Preserve Our Island v. United States Army Corps of Eng\'rs, 70 ERC (BNA) 1622, slip op. 46-47 (D.C.W. D. Wash. 2009). The no action baseline comparison in an EIS also cannot properly include elements that would not comply with law. Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Kempthorne, 520 F.3d 1024, 1038 (9th Cir. 2008); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U. S. Dept. of Interior, 623 F.3d 633, 642 (9th Cir. 2010); Conservation Northwest v. Rey, 674 F. Supp. 2d 1232, 1245-1246 (D.C. W.D. Wash., 2009). Where an agency has ignored its duty, the result cannot be presented as a fait accompli in the baseline for an EIS. Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Kempthorne, supra, 520 F.3d at 1037-38. The LTVSMC taconite tailings plant has been closed since 2000 when the LTV Steel Mining Company declared bankruptcy. Seepage concentrations are naturally attenuating as a result of precipitation and dilution. Cliffs Erie, L.L.C., which became legally responsible for permit compliance in 2001 when it acquired the LTVSMC property, is under the legal obligation of a 2010 consent decree (attached to WaterLegacy’s SDEIS comments as Exhibit 8) to remediate tailings waste facility pollution. The failure of the LTVSMC tailings facility to control seepage and remediate pollution may, to some degree, be a regulatory lapse45 that cannot be considered as a fait accompli in the baseline for an EIS. In addition, under the terms of its purchase agreement with Cliffs Erie, since 2006 the PolyMet Company has indemnified Cliffs Erie for remediation obligations at the tailings site and is “working closely” with Cliffs to fulfill Cliffs’ legal obligations. (PolyMet 2015 SEC Form 20-F, Exhibit 23, pp. 18-19). It would be an improper use of the concept of “no action” to allow Cliffs’ and PolyMet’s delay in taking action to remediate tailings basin seepage to distort the baseline for determining the effects of future sulfide mine pollution. This is not an academic question. As discussed in Section I on mercury, the FEIS claims the PolyMet NorthMet project would reduce CEC modeled sulfate loads to the Embarrass River, at least under the FEIS’ assumption of nearly perfect seepage collection. But, if the NorthMet project’s sulfide tailings seepage were compared with a “no action” baseline, including attenuation and remediation under the consent decree, this evaluation could show the NorthMet action increases rather than decreases sulfate and other pollutants. The FEIS doesn’t even allow an answer to the most basic question – Would sulfate pollution be better or worse if the PolyMet NorthMet project were built? On water quality issues, the FEIS does not allow a fair comparison of environmental outcomes between the proposed action and the no build alternative.']"

In Canada ANFO release has been studied and it has been necessary to regulate a Canadian report states ANFO is regulated in surface water using the following statement: Because of the potential adverse environmental effects of ANFO, its use in Canada is regulated by Section 36(3) of the Fisheries Act (1985), which prohibits the deposit of deleterious substances into waters frequented by fish, unless otherwise permitted by regulation. There is no regulation pursuant to the Fisheries Act that permits the deposit of by-products resulting from the use of ammonium nitrate-fuel oil mixtures. Also, the use of ANFO near bodies of water is not recommended by the Institute of Makers of Explosives, which stipulates that No use of ammonium nitrate-fuel oil mixtures occurs in or near water due to the production of toxic by- products (ammonia). The report concludes: “The literature review indicates that the most common environmental issues associated with the use of ANFO are related to dissolution of AN and to oil wicking. Nitrates and ammonium are readily soluble in water, and thus can very easily reach groundwater. Nitrates exceeding the CCME guidelines (2003) of 13 mg NO3-/L for freshwater (or 16 mg NO3-/L for the protection of marine life) are at risk of causing methaemoglobin, especially in babies. In addition, the presence of nitrate in marine water will cause algal blobs and eutrophication. The toxicity of the ammonium ion is low, but the ammonium in water is in equilibrium with ammonia, which is characterized by a much higher toxicity. Aquatic life is affected when concentrations of ammonia exceed 0.019 mg/L (CCME, 2000). In addition, ammonia in concentrations above 25 mg/m3 for a 15-minute period or the IDHL of 210 mg/m3 (NIOSH, 2007) poses a health hazard to humans. However, this situation is not likely to happen to CF members, given the fact that ANFO is usually handled outside.” (Defence R& D Canada, Jan 2010). - The FEIS failed to evaluate impacts from oil wicking of ANFO (Defence R& D Canada, Jan 2010).', 'Questions have been raised regarding PolyMet’s goal of eventually transitioning from mechanical to non-mechanical water treatment. As stated in comments from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (Section of Fisheries): “The overview of the transitional approach from mechanical to non-mechanical treatment technologies as presented is highly speculative, particularly in terms of success in development of and timing of installation of a successful system.” (Extended comments on NorthMet PFEIS, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources – Section of Fisheries, Comments 4 and 5, 2015). The Department itself, therefore, has exposed the inadequacy of the FEIS to address all issues of importance. Another consideration is that non-mechanical water treatment methods (biofilter and infiltration basin systems) have proven ineffective at the Flambeau Mine site in treating contaminated stormwater runoff. For example, in 1998 (after the Flambeau pit was backfilled), runoff from the southeast corner of the mine site was directed to a man-made biofilter/detention basin in efforts to “clarify collected runoff ” and “improve water quality.” Soil sampling in this particular corner of the mine site, where the ore crusher, high-sulfur waste rock stockpile and rail spur were located during operations, has demonstrated elevated levels of copper that appear to correlate with high levels of copper in runoff. Prior to 2012, the biofilter discharge was directed to a small tributary of the Flambeau River known as Stream C, declared navigable at the time of the mine permit hearing in 1990. Despite non-mechanical treatment of the runoff, however, the discharge consistently contained copper levels exceeding the toxicity standard set to protect fish and other aquatic species (the toxicity standard for copper, adjusted for hardness conditions at Flambeau, is about 3-5 ppb). Environmental monitoring reports show that at times the copper levels in the water exiting the biofilter (e.g., 42 ppb in Sep 2011) were actually higher than the levels measured in the runoff entering the biofilter for treatment (e.g., 17 ppb in Sep 2011), the exact opposite of the desired effect. In 2010 the Wisconsin DNR initiated a study to assess the health of Stream-C and later issued a report in which the Department concluded, “Water quality monitoring done at the site between 2002 and 2011 showed that Stream C and its contributing drainageways contained copper and zinc concentrations that frequently exceeded acute toxicity criteria (ATC). On average, copper exceeded ATC’s in 92% of samples, and zinc exceeded ATC’s in 46% of samples.” Upon recommendation of the Wisconsin DNR, Stream C was added to the EPA’s Section 303(d) Clean Water Act list of “impaired waters,” effective April 2012, for copper and zinc toxicity linked to the Flambeau Mine operation. In early 2012 the owner of the Flambeau Mine converted the biofilter to an infiltration basin (another form of nonmechanical treatment), but this option, too, was a failure. Instead of water percolating downward into the earth with the desired effect of contaminant attenuation, the basin and a second one constructed at the Flambeau site tended to fill to capacity and nearly overtop each year with the Spring melt. As noted by the Wisconsin DNR in an email sent to Foth (the Flambeau consultant responsible for designing the infiltration basins), “we clearly cannot continue responding frantically every spring when the North and East Basins fill up to capacity. This is not a viable management strategy.” The failure of non-mechanical water treatment systems at Flambeau does not bode well for PolyMet’s stated goal of eventually transitioning from mechanical to non-mechanical treatment methods. The PolyMet FEIS is inadequate in that the possibility of outright failure in establishing workable non-mechanical treatment systems has not been fully evaluated.', 'The FEIS does not address the need for pumping and treating water from areas adjacent to the pits during mining, or the potential for elevated concentrations of nitrate and ammonia from blasting agents. The FEIS failed to take a “hard look” at the possibility that runoff from the area around the pits could have elevated concentrations of nitrate and ammonia from blasting agents, and that the area around the pits will need to be dewatered by pumping. The FEIS thus failed to consider the need for this additional pumping, which would add water to the total to be treated, including the need to treat process water for ammonium and nitrate. Mine water that has been in contact with blasting agents, including leachate from stockpile materials stored at the mine site and the pit walls, will have elevated concentrations of ammonia and nitrate from the use of high volumes of blasting agents such as emulsifiers, boosters, and ammonium nitrate – fuel oil (ANFO). The treatment pilot tests, however, assumed that mine water would have near-background levels of nitrate and ammonia, and so the effectiveness of the selected methods for removal of these constituents under mining conditions has not been properly tested or considered. The FEIS discloses that large amounts of explosives will be needed to create the open pits: 18,650 lb/yr for the booster, 4.65 million lb/yr for the emulsion, and 10.6 million lb/yr for ANFO. As result, nitrate, ammonia, and oil & grease concentrations could be high in primary contaminant sources at mine sites and downstream. For instance, the significant exceedence of permit limits for nitrate in downgradient groundwater and surface water has been seen at the Buckhorm Mine. However, while the FEIS lists that the “environmental concern” from these hazardous materials includes harm to water and aquatic life, the FEIS fails to actually consider and address the effects of blasting on water quality. Indeed the objectives for wastewater treatment at the Mine Site do not even include mention of nitrate or ammonia removal. The agencies’ response to comments on this issue is inadequate. First, no response was provided for concerns about ammonia removal. And for treatment of nitrates, the response states that the WWTF will also be of modular construction, such that additional modules can be added for increased capacity if necessary. However, because nitrate, ammonia, and oil & grease concentrations will increase as soon as blasting begins (during mine development), treatment approaches cannot be addressed using adaptive management but must rather be in place before mining begins.252 The response also states that nitrate will be addressed at the Plant Site if nitrate is included in the discharge permit.253 However, much of the water at the Plant Site comes from the Mine Site, and the response ignores the potential for transport of mine water to downgradient groundwater and surface water at the Mine Site. The FEIS also fails to address that neither chemical precipitation nor filtration, which are the planned treatment schemes at the mine site, will remove nitrate or ammonia. The FEIS further fails to properly address nitrate and ammonia in environmental modeling. And, the FEIS fails to include mitigation measures or pollution prevention plans for minimizing the use of blasting chemicals.']"

The Conservancy\'s comments described concerns and recommended remedies that should be included in the FEIS. However, many of the concerns were dismissed with no relevant explanation leaving gaps in the analysis necessary to evaluate the environmental consequences of alternatives.

As described in detail above, the FEIS fails to base its assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed Project on sound scientific analysis across a range of significant environmental impacts – including water quality, mercury loading, wetlands, air quality, and wild rice, among others. Instead, the FEIS bases its conclusions on flawed application of its models, incorrect baseline data, and untested assumptions. As set out above, the Band and others have provided scientific analysis which refutes the conclusions reached in the FEIS. The FEIS’s failure to give effect to the relevant available data and the relevant substantial scientific analysis leads the FEIS to conclusions that are arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by the evidence in the record.

Some liners are damaged during installation, but most damage occurs when the liner is covered by drainage or protective soil.82 The relevance to water quality predictions is again linked to model inputs. The west equalization basin receives highly contaminated process water from stockpile liner drainage, OSP liner and reject concentrate (brine) from the WWTP, all with high levels of sulfate and metals. The east equalization basin receives drainage from the haul roads, the RTH, pit dewatering and the Category 1 Waste Rock Stockpile drainage, with relatively lower sulfate and metals concentrations but still requiring ultrafiltration/nanofiltration.83 If a substantially higher (and more realistic) rate of concentrated contaminant leakage to groundwater is incorporated into the mine site water model, it would likely result in significantly different water quality model predictions.', 'Regarding the lack of support for the assumption that liners at the hydrometallurgical facility will actually work as projected, the response to comments merely reiterates the fact that the proponent intends to use a double liner and a leakage recovery system.169 This response is given despite an absence of information in the NEPA documents about the liners and their real-world success rate, or studies showing how they would operate in Northern Minnesota with these specific wastes.

Since the DEIS was released in 2009, the Co-Lead Agencies made the strategic decision that, with a double liner system, it can be assumed “that the Hydromet Facility will have no leakage.” (Water Resources/Groundwater IAP Memo, SDEIS reference MDNR et al 2011b, pdf p. 13).

Those of us who know the truth realize, Polymet will also need to meet these standards along their way while providing much needed economic resources to working families in our area. 10 years is enough already, please see this project through.', ""Having grown up in Hoyt Lakes and its surrounding forests, I have deep concerns about the long-reaching, and long-lasting effects of Polymet's proposed operations in regards to wildlife populations ( particularly lynx, gray wolf, moose, and others), and am also concerned about air and water quality. I am aware too, of the lack of employment and growth on the Iron range, and do have grave concerns about this- however, in my view, without the healthy land and ecosystems seen in the area, all else becomes a moot point. I am not convinced that a large mining operation, nor its investors, have the best interests of the land and its inhabitants as a top priority. Money becomes the bottom line- but the life of and on the land itself is not something that can be readily renewed or brought back once damage is done. Put simply, I am not convinced Polymet is to be trusted, and I am also unconvinced that their operations will never cause lasting, unmitigated harm.""]"

It ignores the huge swings in weather worldwide due to climate change. Floods and droughts occur at rates far more devastating and frequent than the Gold-Sims recognizes. A thorough FEIS would possibly consult Minnesota’s state extension climatologist, Mark Seeley. A thorough FEIS would check several other sources on climate. 90+ percent of the world’s scientists are not likely to be wrong about climate change. Realistically, the NorthMet Project and the other even larger companies one can anticipate mining in northeastern Minnesota will not operate under previously existing weather conditions, but a remarkably different climate.', '“While climate change may occur in the future, it cannot be stated at this time if in the long-term there would be more or less rainfall.” This assumption is false. Data provided by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources State Climatology Office (Figure 1), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/) (Figure 2) , United States Geological Survey (http://www.usgs.gov/climate_landuse/clu_rd/nccv/viewer.asp), and National Climate Assessment (Figure 3) indicate otherwise. Why is projected precipitation data not incorporated into the FEIS? Further, I take great concern with this statement: ""If over time, climate change causes a gradual increase in annual rainfall, the 100 year storm event would be redefined to a larger value and mine facilities would be upgraded to handle a larger design storm"" (page A-670). It is simply not okay to wait for an extreme precipitation event to upgrade facilities to handle such events. This facility should be capable of handling not only 100-year storm events, but 500-year storm events. Why is the facility not designed to handle large (100-year and 500-year statistical probability) storm events?', 'Throughout this FEIS, the Cumulative Effects (CE) sections fail to provide rationale for assumptions used in estimating CE and fail to demonstrate methodology for estimating CE in highly complex systems such as NorthMet Mining Project and related human activities. For example, the most profound meteorological changes in human history have been occurring recently at increasing rates, caused primarily by CO2 emissions and related GHG pollution from burning fossil fuels, yet the FEIS appears to not have used in their projections scientific data regarding the estimates for past, current and future severe weather events and related ecological impacts of Climate Change. The NorthMet proposed project adds small but measurable emissions to the known ‘drivers’ of climate change; but more importantly, the rapidly changing meteorological conditions of climate change will impact directly and indirectly the proposed NorthMet mining activities themselves. I found no detailed systems analyses of CE that incorporate current science into projections of the potential impacts of this NorthMet project and related human activities. This is one of several deficiencies that impair one’s ability to accurately assess the extent to which the FEIS addresses both the ‘letter and the law’ of NEPA and MEPA.']"

On closer review, the reference to a pilot test for PolyMet NorthMet mine pollution treatment is somewhat of a misnomer, particularly as applied to mercury reduction. The single pilot test report cited in the FEIS is a Barr document (FEIS ref. Barr 2013f). This report does not substantiate the efficacy of NorthMet wastewater treatment to remove mercury in compliance with the 1.3 ng/L standard. The PolyMet pilot test was conducted on water drawn from a seep and an aquifer well at the existing LTVSMC taconite tailings waste facility (Barr 2013f, p. 11). Mercury was below detectible levels in the influent for the test (Id., autop. 64-69, Table 1, Table 2). The only conclusions regarding mercury in Barr report were based on literature and an inquiry to the membrane supplier. Barr reported, “Mercury removal by RO membranes is highly dependent on the type of membrane used. Mercury rejections [the percentage removed by treatment] ranging from 22 to 99.9% have been reported,” (Id., p. 39). The report continued, “Mercury removal by RO is highly variable and dependent upon its speciation and the membrane selection. For these reasons, its removal is difficult to quantify,” (Id., p. 41). Should mercury influent to the WWTP exceed 1.3 ng/L, the FEIS does not provide any basis to conclude that water quality treatment will result in compliance with the 1.3 ng/L GLI and Minnesota water quality standard for mercury.', 'The WWTP will use reverse osmosis to remove contamination from Tailings Basin seepage. The FEIS discusses a pilot test for the WWTP that was conducted in 2012. Unfortunately, the WWTP pilot test never evaluated mercury removal using reverse osmosis. In fact, as the Pilot Test report itself states, the WWTP designers don’t know how much mercury can be removed by the WWTP. The report states that maybe as little as 20 percent, or maybe as much as 99 percent, of mercury might be removed. One guestimate is given by a salesperson for PolyMet’s membrane manufacturer of “about 70 percent” for mercury removal. Even then, according to the FEIS documents, removal of methylmercury does not appear possible using the planned WWTP design. In other words, removal of the most hazardous species of mercury, the one that bio accumulates in fish and humans, has not even been considered in the WWTP design.', 'The FEIS incorrectly states that the Pilot-testing has indicated that treated effluent from the Plant Site would meet water quality standards for all regulated constituents. As discussed above, the WWTP Pilot Test did not determine whether mercury would be removed by the WWTP. The FEIS should be updated to reflect this fact. A partial list of suggestions is provided below: 14.1 Table 5.2.2-29 should be modified to include mercury as a target. Table 5.2.2-28 provides the WWTF preliminary water quality targets. Mercury is not included but should have been included. After mercury is added as a target effluent, design of the WWTF should be evaluated for mercury removal, and a review should be made of FEIS analysis and conclusions that presumed mercury did not need a WWTF water quality target. This review should include evaluation of alternatives that were prematurely eliminated. 14.2 Page 5-147 should be modified to clarify that mercury removal was not tested in the pilot plant. Suitable language could include: “Table 5.2.2-29 presents the target WWTF effluent concentrations for the different mine phases. Pilot-testing of a WWTF with RO demonstrated that all of the target closure effluent concentrations could be achieved with the planned WWTF design, with the possible exception of mercury, for which no pilot testing has been undertaken and for which significant disagreements exist on viability of removal by RO processes.” 14.3 Page 5-226 of the FEIS should be amended to include statements from the Pilot Plant Test that removal of mercury using RO technology is uncertain. Potential language to consider is: “It should be noted that the West Pit overflow would be treated by the WWTF using RO technology prior to discharge, and the RO process is known to remove mercury. However, as indicated in the Pilot Test Report, there are disagreements in the literature about how much mercury can be removed, and the most dangerous form of mercury (methylmercury) has been reported as unremovable using RO methods.” 14.4 Table 5.2.2-51 should be modified to provide correct information of estimated mercury concentration of the combined inflows to the Plant Site WWTP Table 5.2.2-51 describes Mercury Concentration from Tailings Basin seepage water and Runoff (not interacting with tailings) to be 1.0 ng/L, which is below Great Lakes standard levels. In fact, mercury levels for these two sources will likely be higher than these estimated levels. NorthMet FEIS Comment – Daniel Pauly – Page 42 Correcting this error is essential because these two sources of inflows are expected to account for over 80 percent of the water inflows into the WWTP, and will impact feasibility and design of the WWTP, as well as long term costs to operate the WWTP.']"

Is it treated? Does it collect somewhere else? And secondly, with global warming, we don't know the definition of a rare event. The probability of high rainfall storms may increase. What volume of overflow is expected as a function of total rainfall in an event at different freeboards? How long would the bypass event last vs. total rainfall for different freeboards? This is where XY plots are needed. What mass of pollutants makes it to the Polymet boundary? What happens if the ground is frozen? Or if it's very saturated?"", 'As mentioned elsewhere in our comments, unexpected climatic changes are leading to increased incidences of severe rainfall events. On page 120, the FEIS makes an assumption that, “An emergency overflow channel would be constructed as a backup means of controlling pond elevation, but discharge from the emergency overflow to the environment is not expected. The emergency overflow would be provided for protection of the dams in the rare event that freeboard within the Tailings Basin is not sufficient to contain all storm water.” The fact that the overflow will be provided is important, but this should not be the sole protection in place to prevent a Mount Polley-type dam breach. With toxic heavy metal leachate in the tailings pond water and sediment, every effort to safeguard against a breach should be considered responsible management.', 'In discussing the impact of the project on aquatic life, the FEIS provides one mention of spills: a reassurance that “spill prevention plans” would be implemented. (FEIS, 5-467). The FEIS states that an emergency overflow channel would be constructed to discharge untreated tailings pond water as a back up means of controlling pond levels in the event of “a probable maximum precipitation rainfall event or some fraction thereof.” (FEIS, 3-120). The FEIS does not specify what “fraction” of a maximum rainfall event would require emergency discharge or analyze the frequency of extreme weather events given climate change; the FEIS only discusses average increases in precipitation as a result of climate change. (FEIS, 5- 223, 5-254, 5-506). Yet, the FEIS asserts that discharge from the emergency overflow “would not be expected.” (FEIS, 3-120, 5-120). The FEIS does not estimate any adverse impacts of spills or discharge of untreated wastewater from the tailings pond during heavy rains. As discussed previously, despite work plans explaining the uncertainty in performance of engineered systems, the FEIS assumes certainty or nearly perfect seepage collection and provides no assessment of impacts on water quality should routine operations fail to perform as “expected.”']"

These word choices and changes are curious in the sense that they have actually muddied the waters instead of adding clarity to the final draft of the document. If these sorts of word choices are to be made, the public deserves to know WHO made them, and WHY. Without some sort of personal accountability (i.e., naming names), too many things can be slipped under the rug, to the public’s detriment. For example, please see page ES-26 of the PFEIS and compare to page ES-24 of the FEIS. The former states the following as the lead-off sentence to the first new paragraph in column 1: “Water quality modeling performed in support of the FEIS indicates that water treatment systems would be needed at the Mine Site and Plant Site indefinitely.” The paragraph ends with the following: “Both mechanical and non- mechanical treatment would require periodic maintenance and monitoring activities for as long as treatment is required (indefinitely).” Please compare this to the rendition that appears in the FEIS (page ES-24). The above-cited lead-off sentence was deleted from the corresponding paragraph, and the word “indefinitely” was removed from the final sentence. Instead, the information is now buried in the middle of the first paragraph of the second column, where it’s much less prominent. The information that water treatment systems would be needed “indefinitely” at the PolyMet project site is critical to impact analysis, as reflected by the fact that the above-cited sentence (or variations thereof) appears about 20 times throughout the body of the EIS. Yet, this crucial information was relegated to second-class status in the Executive Summary of the FEIS, the part of the document that would get the most traffic. Whose idea was this? The public needs (and deserves) to know who is masking critical information so citizens might better pass judgment on the integrity of the EIS process (and therefore the integrity of the document itself). A second example: Please compare p. 5-173 of the PFEIS to page 5-174 of the FEIS. It looks like someone was trying to “muddy the waters” by changing phraseology. The term “water quality standards” in the PFEIS was changed to “evaluation criterion” in the FEIS. The average citizen certainly would understand the former phraseology better than the latter. Again, whose idea was this? The public needs (and deserves) to know who is “muddying the waters” in what appears to be an effort to downplay information that justifiably would raise public concern. A third example: Please compare p. 3-2 of the DEIS to p. 3-4 of the FEIS. The DEIS clearly indicates tonnages of the various metals to be produced by the PolyMet operation (and therefore subject to taxation). Yet, the FEIS indicates tonnages of various concentrates and precipitates without disclosing their actual concentrations. As stated earlier, the production values reported in the FEIS are somewhat meaningless. It’s like going to a liquor store and being told the volume of a bottle of vodka instead of being told the volume AND proof. Again, whose idea was this to use funny numbers to describe production values? The public and state decisionmakers need (and deserve) to know real production numbers so they can decide if the environmental risks are “worth it” in terms of potential tax revenues. Curious word choices used in the FEIS: Who decided to call the location of the PolyMet tailings dump and processing plant the “Plant Site” when the vast acreage associated with the site is tied to the dump (3,000 acres) rather than the processing plant (perhaps 200 acres)? o Who decided to use the term “hydrometallurgical residue” instead of the more broadly understood term, “tailings” to describe the waste generated by the hydromet plant? Surely the latter term would have done a better job at alerting the public to the toxic nature of the waste. o Who decided to characterize groundwater drawdown, changes in water quality and other potential changes to wetlands at the PolyMet project site as “indirect” impacts, when those effects indeed would be directly caused by the mine? The use of the term “indirect” in the EIS does not meet the common dictionary definition of the word and, to PolyMet’s unfair advantage, tends to minimize the connection between the mine and what could be some very serious impacts. ? Curious timing of the release of the FEIS: The PolyMet EIS process has been underway for, what, about 10 years now? Yet, someone decided that the 3,500 page FEIS had to be released now, over the busy holiday season (when people need and deserve to have time with their families) and to give the public a mere 30 days to respond. This curious timing has made it more difficult for working-class people in the community to offer comment on this very important decision. Whose idea was it to release the FEIS in mid-November and impose a 30-day deadline over the holiday season? The above are examples of what appear to be questionable decisions made by one or more people involved in the EIS process. It’s time for the co-lead agencies to “name the names” of those who are responsible for what appears to be a thinly-veiled attempt to mask unpalatable elements of the FEIS with “feel good” language and minimize public participation in the review process. The public needs and deserves to know who is really “calling the shots” here so they might better judge the integrity of the EIS process (and therefore the integrity of the FEIS itself). Without this type of full disclosure and transparency, the FEIS must be deemed inadequate.', 'While the Conservation Organizations recognize that PolyMet’s statements are not part of the FEIS, they are supported by statements in the FEIS that have no place in an agency document. An agency is obligated to assess the effectiveness of potential mitigation measures.240 In this case, the Co-Lead Agencies have concluded that the potential mitigation measure is not effective at all because it relies upon non-existent technology, yet continue to discuss it at multiple points throughout the FEIS, including the Executive Summary: The NorthMet Project Proposed Action includes long-term mechanical treatment (RO or equivalently performing technology) at both the Mine Site and Plant Site with a goal of transitioning to a non- mechanical water treatment technology requiring less maintenance over the long term. Pilot studies for non-mechanical treatment would be conducted during operations (and post-closure as necessary) to demonstrate the ability to transition to non-mechanical water treatment. Both mechanical and non-mechanical treatment would require periodic maintenance and monitoring activities for as long as treatment is required.241 Also, in response to public comments that treatment would be essentially perpetual, the Co-Lead Agencies responded: Minnesota Rules, part 6132.3200, Closure and Postclosure Maintenance, identifies several goals for non-ferrous mining areas, including the goal that sites be closed so that they are maintenance-free. A maintenance-free site is the goal of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) for the NorthMet Project Proposed Action, as it is for every mining site. The NorthMet Project Proposed Action includes piloting a non-mechanical treatment system to achieve this goal. PolyMet would include funds in its reclamation cost estimate and financial assurance package to fund mechanical water treatment for as long as necessary, but the Permit to Mine would require PolyMet to present a plan for eventual transition from mechanical water treatment to non-mechanical treatment. PolyMet cannot be released from its responsibilities, including financial assurance requirements, until there is no longer a need for closure/post-closure treatment/maintenance. Financial assurance is a component of any Permit to Mine, to ensure that necessary maintenance can be provided for as long as it necessary.242 Over the course of any project, technology changes and improves, and sometimes projects are implemented differently than predicted in an EIS where technology that is newer, better or less costly becomes available. Yet there is no doubt that the original 500-year predictions for water pollution in the SDEIS quickly became the most controversial aspect of this project.243 The current FEIS still concedes that mechanical treatment is required for at least 200 years at the Mine Site and 500 Years at the Plant Site.244 Thus, it appears that FEIS continually repeats the goal of non-mechanical treatment solely for political reasons to address public concerns about committing to a mine that requires hundreds of years of water treatment, rather than any justifiable belief that this is a proven mitigation measure.', 'The discussion of “passive” treatment in the FEIS is misleading and should be removed. The “passive” or “non-mechanical” treatment is as yet undeveloped, and there is no evidence that it will ever prove technically capable of treating water at this site to the levels used for the WWTF effluent in the water quality modeling. While the FEIS does state that the agencies are not relying on passive treatment for water quality predictions, and that the need for mechanical water treatment is assumed to be long-term, the placement of the material on passive treatment has the effect of insinuating that this assumption probably will not prove true. This insinuation in concert with the failure to define “long-term” does not provide the “hard look” at the need for perpetual treatment.233 The FEIS and supporting documents assume throughout that unproven passive treatment systems will be implemented. For instance, the FEIS contains a section describing the predicted transition from mechanical to non-mechanical treatment: As described in the Water Management section above, water modeling for the NorthMet Project Proposed Action and the environmental analysis in Chapter 5 assumes that mechanical water treatment would continue indefinitely. PolyMet would include funds in its contingency reclamation estimate and financial assurance package to operate mechanical water treatment for as long as necessary as a part of its Permit to Mine. However, the Permit to Mine would also require PolyMet to present a plan for eventual transition from mechanical water treatment to non-mechanical water treatment, and to adjust its financial assurance on an annual basis in accordance with Minnesota Rules, part 6132.1200 to conform to the transition. This section provides an overview of the transitional approach from mechanical water treatment to the use of non-mechanical treatment technologies. PolyMet would transition from mechanical to non-mechanical water treatment as soon as the company demonstrates that non-mechanical water treatment technologies would effectively treat water to meet water quality based effluent limits and as soon as formal approval is received from the agencies. Non-mechanical water treatment technologies need to be designed for site-specific conditions and actual site water quality. PolyMet accordingly would test non-mechanical water treatment technologies for several years during mine operations and reclamation, until an acceptable treatment performance could be achieved. Non- mechanical water treatment technologies can be evaluated in the following steps: 1) collection of additional local site information (i.e., hydrology and influent water quality), 2) laboratory testing, 3) pilot-scale testing, 4) design of a system for full-scale implementation, and 5) continued evaluation of effectiveness over time. The conceptual design for a non- mechanical treatment system is to treat each flow expected in the long term. The Adaptive Water Management Plan (PolyMet 2015d) outlines preliminary/conceptual information on non-mechanical treatment systems. PolyMet has initiated testing of non-mechanical water treatment technologies on site (in collaboration with Cliffs Erie) and will continue testing these systems and evaluating other non-mechanical water treatment technologies until they could be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the MDNR and MPCA to provide the required water treatment. Provisions would be included in the NorthMet Project financial assurance package to ensure this test work and implementation of the non-mechanical water treatment technologies could be completed.234 The Adaptive Water Management Plan, cited in the FEIS above, treats the transition to non-mechanical treatment as a certainty, with the only question being timing: The ultimate goal of long-term closure (Figure 2-4 and Figure 2-5) is to transition from the mechanical treatment provided by the WWTF to non-mechanical treatment. Because non-mechanical treatment designs are very site-specific and very dependent on the quality of the water to be treated, it is assumed that the WWTF will operate in the long-term and the transition to non-mechanical treatment will take place only after the performance of a non-mechanical system has been tested on site, proven effective, and approved by the agencies. The two non-mechanical treatment systems at the Mine Site are independent of each other. It is expected that the Category 1 Waste Rock Stockpile Non-Mechanical Treatment System will be deployed earlier than the West Pit Overflow Non-Mechanical Treatment System, as described in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. As noted previously, water from the Category 1 Waste Rock Stockpile will continue to be treated by the WWTF until non-mechanical treatment with gravity discharge to the West Pit has been proven to provide appropriate treatment. This may occur during reclamation or long-term closure... Operation of the WWTF will occur year-round with the discharge directed to a small watercourse that flows into the Partridge River until non-mechanical treatment has been proven effective at achieving water quality objectives.']"

Warmed augmentation water from Colby Lake WILL kill off colder water fish along with other effects that need to be Further researched.', ""Table 5.2.2-47 is misleading because it uses sulfate levels based on Barr and not DNR readings for Colby Lake water which were higher and because it includes Spring Mine Creek water [p.4-122 Spring Mine Creek, which receives drainage from Pit SNW (see Figure 4.2.2-1). Pit SNW is completely flooded and has been overflowing since before 2001 with an annual average flow of about 2 cfs to the Embarrass River via Spring Mine Creek. This discharge has sulfate concentrations that average 1,042 mg/L (PolyMet 2013j).]which won't be augmented. The net effect of the Colby Lake augmentation is a net increase that will be detrimental to downstream rice beds which are already fragile from existing sulfate exposure. The Colby Lake discharges will be less subject to the attenuation of current flows because they will be released on the surface and not subjected to ground effect filtering. Total stream water concentrations of sulfate are more relevant here than concentrations close to the tailings basin. Two thirds of the augmentation water will go to Trimble creek which has according to this SDEIS average sulfate levels of 12.4 at TC1 and 26.8 at PM19 and Mud Lake Creek which will receive about 1/6 th of augmentation has readings at MLC 1 of 9.8 and MLC 2 of 3.2 mg/L, inadequate data is provided for unnamed creak which will receive less than 1/4th augmentation from Colby Lake from years 21-40 (Table 4.2.2-35). Difference between actual from those given in the SDEIS and differences between Barr and MDNR readings are the product of manipulation. For example, a higher reading will result when taken during lower water levels when concentrations are higher and for Colby Lake water different concentrations of sulfates will occur at different depths. Modeling charts 5.2.2-50 and 5.2.2-51 contradict SDEIS actual readings( In Trimble and Mud Creeks) and known sulfates( according to SDEIS figures) in Colby Lake augmentation water."", 'The only change made in the PolyMet NorthMet project in response to WaterLegacy’s comments regarding mercury is that the project no longer proposes to use untreated high mercury Colby Lake water for stream augmentation in the wetlands complex north of the tailings waste facility, identified in the SDEIS as a high-risk location for mercury methylation. The FEIS states that Colby Lake water will be treated at the tailings site wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) prior to use for stream augmentation (FEIS, 2-10). However, the benefit of this change is uncertain, since the FEIS fails to analyze how mercury inputs from Colby Lake water transfer would affect tailings pond, tailings seepage and the WWTP. These impacts are likely to be significant. Colby Lake water mercury concentrations substantially exceed the Great Lakes Initiative (GLI) and Minnesota water quality standard of 1.3 nanograms per liter (ng/L). Data provided in the FEIS state total mercury concentrations in Colby Lake are between 4.6 and 8.7 ng/L, averaging 6.0 ng/L (FEIS, 4-37 to 4-38). During operations, maximum plant site water appropriation of water from Colby Lake would be 15.1 million gallons per day (MGD) or 1,300 million gallons per year (MGY) (FEIS, 5-201, Table 5.2.2-40). This maximum is equivalent to 10,486 gallons per minute (gpm) from Colby Lake. Despite the high concentration of mercury in Colby Lake water and the volume of Colby Lake water that would be piped to the plant site, the FEIS’ estimate of mercury in the inflows to the WWTP (FEIS, 5-230, Table 5.2.2-51) does not consider mercury inputs from Colby Lake water. Comparing the FEIS Table for Estimated Mercury Concentration of the Combined Inflows to the Plant Site WWTP to the same Table in the SDEIS (SDEIS, 5-206, Table 5.2.2-52), no adjustment has been made for an increased mercury concentration resulting from the need to treat Colby Lake water. The FEIS’ prediction that the combined inflows to the WWTP will have a mercury concentration of precisely 1.3 ng/L, the GLI water quality standard, is unchanged. This prediction does not seem to reflect analysis, since the maximum volume of Colby Lake water (average mercury concentration of 6.0 ng/L) is estimated at more than four times the 2,425 gpm total combined stream inflow to the WWTP predicted in the FEIS (FEIS, 5-230, Table 5.2.2-51). The FEIS’ failure to assess the ramifications of high- mercury Colby Lake water inputs is exacerbated by unsubstantiated assertions in the FEIS that the PolyMet NorthMet WWTP will be able to treat mercury through reverse osmosis or “equivalently performing technology” so that effluent will not exceed 1.3 ng/L (FEIS, 5-230, 5-238).']"

However, they have missed describing two beneficial uses at this site. Various other uses are described in the EPA Reference Guide to Treatment Technologies for Mining-Influenced Water, #EPA 542-R-14-00. Given the cost of the project, a relatively small-scale investment in using membrane technology at the start can make the mine a zero liquid discharge site. These technologies’ full potential may not be understood by the engineers and technologists in these organizations. The evidence for this statement is that this option has been ignored in all EIS drafts, plus ignored in the “Fact Sheets”. To not even list this approach as an alternative is an omission that may indicate an ignorance of the modern mine sites currently operating with proactive treatment, instead of impoundment, storage and treatment plans postponed for decades and predicated on optimistic water chemistry projections and storage basin stability outcomes.', 'Certainly the technology exists to treat virtually any water, no matter how contaminated, to a level suitable for discharge to surface waters or even for consumption by humans. As contaminant levels become higher and treatment objectives become more stringent, costs increase, often exponentially. PolyMet has in its proposal suggested that reverse osmosis (RO) would be a technology of choice for treatment of pit overflow water and leachates from the waste rock pile, tailings impoundment and hydrometallurgical waste repository. Water treatment using reverse osmosis requires significant pretreatment of water otherwise RO membranes fail miserably. By and large this treatment process will require a highly sophisticated operational staff and significant financial resources for materials, supplies and plant maintenance. This is all fine and well as long as PolyMet maintains the financial will to operate the plant, which, based on PolyMet’s own predictions, will likely be needed for centuries into the future. Unfortunately, historically, the mining industry is rife with examples of mining companies that have gone “belly up” at the prospect of dealing with the messes they’ve made. One need only to do a quick internet search to inform oneself of many key instances – Brohm Mining in South Dakota, Galactic Resources in Colorado, and Pegasus Gold in Montana are three recent infamous cases. PolyMet itself is a subsidiary corporation that has been formed specifically for this project, in part to limit the liability of the parent companies and associated investors from financial risks associated with the potential failure of the project. Belief that PolyMet will be around and will have the financial will to operate this treatment system long after the profits from the mining operation have been realized and banked by CEOs, top managers, and investors is akin to adult belief in the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy. Approval of this project based on a closure strategy relying on long-term treatment of pit water and leachate will commit the State of Minnesota and its people to the very costly cleanup of this mess that PolyMet intends to make in the interests of large monetary profits for a select few and ephemeral jobs for a few more.', 'The Revised Final EIS is inadequate because there are two major and fundamental flaws with the described current PolyMet NorthMet Project plan for preventing and treating wastewater (in order to prevent significant water pollution). Importantly, both flaws are easily remedied. Although ore and tailings wastewater discharge is expected from the start of mining operations, treatment of the pollution and potential for future pollution characteristic of these wastewaters is delayed for decades, while it is (hopefully all) collected and stored in various locations. It is exactly such wastewater storage decisions (e.g. delayed treatment) that have led to both increased levels of pollution, and to the catastrophic site failures that have plagued hard rock mine sites in the USA and worldwide, and continue to do so where treatment is postponed. The membrane technology (reverse osmosis etc.) which has been often cited as the insurance of water pollution prevention that the pubic and regulators should accept, is not planned for use until decades into the future. This is a major planning error. Further, membrane technology is not even mentioned as a possible treatment to prevent acid mine drainage, which is admitted as a possibility. It is a major omission to not address this as an alternative treatment - by continuous treatment of the relatively low volume of ore and tailing seepage expected from the start of operations. This is a relatively low cost and feasible alternative Nor is it addressed for future impounded wastewater treatment of heavy metal bearing ore and tailings, should acid mine drainage accumulate as it has at a majority of sulfide bearing hard rock mines. These are both serious planning oversights, which ignore an efficient and proactive solution while postponing treatment. This is a major planning error because of simple risk-cost principles.']"

See Section 1.K above. In other words, after the mine is approved and in operation, monitoring would be done to determine potential adverse impacts, and if such were to occur, then future mitigation measures would be identified, developed and implemented on an as-needed basis. But this approach does not avoid or prevent mine related environmental impacts. Monitoring can only detect impacts after they have begun to occur and the adaptive management activities would only be a reaction to an impact. At that point, it may well be too late to prevent or mitigate the damage in any cost-effective or meaningful way.', 'An Adaptive Water Management Plan does not compensate for the lack of an Ecological Risk Assessment. As an alternative to an Ecological Risk Assessment, the FEIS claims that the NorthMet Project Adaptive Water Management Plan (AWMP)55 is sufficient to address future negative impacts on water quality. However, the AWMP is largely a plan describing engineering monitoring and controls that will be in place to detect and manage the environmental impacts to water quality as they arise; i.e. a risk management approach, not a risk assessment. Also, there is nothing in the AWMP to address the severe consequences of a tailings dam failure. In effect, the AWMP proposes how one might respond to a failure, rather than informing decision-makers and the public of the nature of all risks in advance of approving the project. Asserting that problems will be detected and addressed as they arise is no substitute for a rigorous, transparent Ecological Risk Assessment of systems that could fail and the consequences that would follow. Relying on risk management procedures alone, rather than accurately characterizing risks and consequences is similar to the situation that occurred at the Mt. Polley Mine. There, the independent review panel investigating the disaster wrote that ""[mitigating risk of tailings basin failure] was contingent on consistently flawless execution in planning, in subsurface investigation, in analysis and design, in construction quality, in operational diligence, in monitoring, in regulatory actions, and in risk management at every level. All of these activities are subject to human error.""56 Without an assessment of the probability and consequences of risks associated with the potential human and natural causes of engineered systems failures, the FEIS similarly assumes a flawless performance of these engineered systems over centuries and thus fails to provide a reasoned evaluation of the environmental consequences of the proposed mine. II. Summary of Necessary Action on Risk Assessment 1 . The FEIS should include a thorough Ecological Risk Assessment adapting the approach used by the USEPA for Bristol Bay to characterize risks of failure and their environmental consequences.', 'The FEIS is inadequate because it fails to substantively respond to comments establishing the need for the inclusion of an Ecological Risk Assessment. A. Sound engineering practice requires a risk assessment as an essential element of project design. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) asserts that ""effective risk characterization and management is fundamental to engineering.""35 The ASCE makes a point of distinguishing between risk assessment, which is used to characterize risks (both likely and unlikely); risk analysis, which ranks the relative risks of a specific system; and risk management, which is an approach for weighing and mitigating risks. 36 The FEIS does not include a risk assessment or risk analysis. Rather, the FEIS references the Adaptive Water Management Plan (AWMP) for its discussion of risk. The AWMP, while ostensibly a tool for risk management, does not include nor address the fundamental need for characterizing the risks it purports to manage. To be effective, risk management should come only after a thorough risk assessment and risk analysis have been completed. The failure to include a risk assessment in the FEIS denies decisionmakers and the public vital information necessary to evaluate the potential environmental consequences of this project. For a project whose environmental impacts will extend centuries beyond its projected twenty-year operational phase, ignoring this step could result in serious environmental consequences that are not characterized or evaluated in the FEIS. ) The FEIS acknowledges that the proposed mine will produce pollution that could potentially impact water quality for centuries. In response to this environmental threat, the FEIS anticipates near-perpetual operation of the tailings dam and water containment, collection, and treatment systems. Given the expected centuries of operation, there is a substantial risk that one or more of these engineered systems will fail due to natural causes; equipment malfunction, breakage, or age; human error; or lack of funds for maintenance and repair. In light of this risk, the Conservancy and others have urged the agencies to provide a risk assessment of the project in the FEIS. Such a risk assessment would include the probability and environmental consequences of potential failures for each of the following aspects during all phases of the project: the mine site, plant site, transportation corridor, tailings basins, stockpiles, and water containment and treatment systems (hereinafter referred to as ""Ecological Risk Assessment""). 8. An Ecological Risk Assessment is an essential and feasible element of the FEIS. As discussed above, a risk assessment is considered a fundamental engineering practice. The ASCE has noted that it is important, ""to adequately address risk in how systems are planned and designed and how consequences are managed"", and ""urges government agencies and private entities at all levels to incorporate risk management in all decision-making processes.""37 The ASCE goes on to say that ""risk management practices must be clearly communicated to the public"" including encouraging and facilitating public participation in review of risk assessment procedures. 38 The United States Environmental Protection Agency\'s (USEPA) Bristol Bay Assessment demonstrates the feasibility of producing an Ecological Risk Assessment for a large, complex open pit mine at a level of detail sufficient for inclusion in an EIS.39 The assessment, which the USEPA prepared recently for the proposed copper mine in Bristol Bay, Alaska, uses historical evidence to assess the probability of failure over time for the engineered systems commonly found at mines40 and the expected environmental consequences of such failures. In addition to using historic evidence, the assessment also considers future risks from current mines that are designed using state-of-the-practice engineering.41 Because the Proposed Project relies on these same types of engineered systems to protect surface and groundwater quality, the Conservancy and others have called for the inclusion of a similar Ecological Risk Assessment here. By including an assessment in the FEIS, the public would then be afforded the opportunity to review and comment on how risk and environmental consequences compare among alternatives. It would be straightforward to update and adapt the EPA\'s Bristol Bay analysis, apply it to the Proposed Project, and then use it to determine the consequences and costs of potential system failures. However, the FEIS does not include a risk assessment of any kind and implies that the engineered environmental safeguards will flawlessly perform in perpetuity. This implicit use of a ""best case"" scenario .. . \'skews\' the data toward fewer environmental impacts and thus impedes a \'full and fair discussion of the potential effects of the project.\'42 To avoid such an unwarranted skewing of the analysis, the FEIS should include an Ecological Risk Assessment to inform the agencies and the public about the long term environmental consequences of the mine.43 In the response to comments asking for a risk assessment, the FEIS dismisses the request and merely responds that ""[n]either NEPA nor MEPA. ... requires the evaluation of worst-case or failure event scenarios.""44 This answer is non-responsive: commenters were not asking for a ""worst case analysis"", but a realistic risk assessment that could ""generate information and discussion. of those consequences of greatest concern to the public and greatest relevance to the agency decision ... rather than overemphasizing speculative harms.""45']"

The FEIS statement: “An estimate of the spillage of ore fines along the rail corridor is provided in Section 8.4.3 of the Waste Characterization Data Package (PolyMet 2015q). Assuming that all spillage of the coarse material would occur in a 2-meter-wide strip on both sides of the centerline of the railway (total width equals 4 meters) over the entire haul distance after loading (approximately 8 miles or 13,000 meters), results in approximately 0.11 kilograms per square meter (kg/m2) of ore fines annually or 2.14 kg/m2 for the 20- year NorthMet Project Proposed Action. This equates to 0.002 inch of depth annually or 0.05 inches for the 20-year NorthMet Project Proposed Action” 137 is incorrect because these results actually came from PolyMet 2015b. What PolyMet 2015q finds is different. See PolyMet 2015q, Section 8.4.3 - “Assuming that all spillage occurs in a 2 meter wide strip along this portion of the rail corridor, it is estimated that approximately 2.78 kg/m2 could spill annually or 55.7 kg/m2 over the life of the Project. This is equivalent to 1.25 inches of spilled material over a 2,000 m2 area”. The FEIS also leaves out any mention of the 55.7 kg/m2 value. Additionally, the FEIS (page 5-164) states that the spilled material would become rapidly depleted of sulfide materials compared to the waste rock stockpiles. This statement offers nothing in the way of quantification of the amount of sulfide that would be released, nor does it address the metals that would also leach from the material. As mentioned above, PolyMet 2015q predicts that metals concentrations have the potential to exceed water quality standards for four metals: aluminum, cobalt, copper, and nickel. On the basis of this and the above arguments, the Band believes that the FEIS does not adequately address this topic. The FEIS discusses refurbishment of existing ore cars that would reduce spillage by 97%, to 0.20 tons per year. (PolyMet 2014a)”. The Band proposes that this modification requirement be incorporated into the final permit for the facility. The FEIS states that most of the potential spillage from the rail cars will occur within the first 1,000 meters of rail from the Rail Transfer Hopper (page 5-164). The Band disagrees with this assessment. “The Fugitive Dust Risk Management Plan (FDRMP) for Red Dog Operations, Alaska (August 2008, draft) states: “Elevated metal concentrations have been identified in tundra in areas surrounding the DMTS, primarily as a result of deposition of fugitive dust originating from the DMTS corridor, which is used to transport zinc and lead ore concentrates from the Red Dog Mine, operated by Teck Cominco Alaska Incorporated (Teck Cominco)”. The use of 2 meters on either side of the railway is inadequate.', '5.2.4.2.2 Transportation and Utility Corridor Indirect Effects The FEIS analyzes the effect of spillage & blowoff as dust effects to vegetation (Section 5.2.4.2.1) and potential air quality impacts (minimal – Section 5.2.74.2). However, the primary concern for ore scattered along the transportation corridor is on water quality. At the Flambeau mine a small stream located next to the now-closed ore loading terminal is still contaminated with copper from non-point sources. This contamination is most probably related to dust blowoff from the ore trains, since copper is elevated in the entire sub-drainage (Chambers and Zamzow 2009). According to the FEIS, the ore trains would travel on a: ... railroad, which would generally be used to transport ore from the Mine Site to the Plant Site using three to four trains, each consisting of sixteen to twenty 100-ton, side-dumping ore cars ... (Section 3.2.2.2.4 Use During Operations, p. 3-85, emphasis added) The amount of ore spillage was originally estimated to be 6.14 tons per year for unrefurbished cars (PolyMet 2015q). However, after reworking the door hinges, PolyMet estimates the amount of spillage can be reduced 95% (PolyMet 2014a). The quantity of ore that could potentially spill through the door and hinge gaps of a single refurbished ore car is estimated to be 0.20 tons per year.

The [bentonite amendment] plan would be updated as necessary as part of facility permitting, with future in-laboratory material testing performed to confirm percentage of bentonite addition requirements, and with in-field test plots constructed preceding initial cover construction activities to confirm material placement procedures. The specific methods for bentonite amendment at the Tailings Basin, including a material testing program and construction quality control plan would require approval by the facility engineer of record and PolyMet prior transitioning to full-scale implementation.173 This is a misunderstanding of how a NEPA document is meant to function. To the extent that the agencies agree that the effectiveness of bentonite amendments and application to the pond bottom are still untested and unproven—and therefore in need of field and laboratory tests—the environmental review cannot simply assume that the strategy will be successful. The Co-Lead Agencies cannot rely on unproven mitigation measures. As water pollution due to seepage is one of the large risks of this project, it is wholly inappropriate to put off necessary tests until after the FEIS is finalized, and even more inappropriate to assume that the results of those tests will be favorable.', 'In his report prepared in response to the FEIS, Dr. Malusis shows that the analysis remains flawed on key issues. He points out that mixing bentonite into tailings will be less effective than assumed. Tailings “metals will inhibit bentonite swelling as the bentonite hydrates within the mixture, possibly to the extent that the bentonite will not adequately plug the voids in the mixture. If this is the case, then the bentonite-amended tailings layer will be a poor water/oxygen barrier.”174 The current proposals for bentonite additions to dams will not effectively block water or oxygen, and therefore all of the predictions of water quality impacts that are dependent on this mitigation measure are incorrect. Dr. Malusis also indicates that important information is still missing from the FEIS. The inconsistencies regarding, and uncertainty of effectiveness for, bentonite- amended dam raises must be disclosed in the FEIS, along with disclosure of the potential environmental impacts should the plan prove less effective than assumed.', 'PolyMet’s plans include attempts to isolate the tailings from atmospheric oxygen by amending the cover with bentonite. Perhaps PolyMet’s engineers are not completely familiar with the specific properties of bentonite. Saturated bentonite (the mineral montmorillonite, most often in the sodium form) gels hold intercalated water within a layered-silicate structure. Hydrated cations and (their associated water of hydration) are held near the silicon-oxygen layers by negative charges arising from isomorphic substitution of iron (II) and magnesium for aluminum (III) in the octahedrally-coordinated inner (sandwiched between two silicon-oxygen layers) layer of the mineral. Water also bonds with the negatively charged layered structure. The immobilization of water by this bentonite gel is largely responsible for the ability of bentonite-amended soils to retard through-migration of water. The actual overall porosity of such mixtures is near that of the native soil. However, when unsaturated, the bentonite no longer retains its continuous gel properties. Then, the ability of the bentonite-amended soil to retard through-migration of gases is no better than that of the native soil. Thus, unless bentonite-modified soils are maintained in a fully-saturated state, there is no real advantage to bentonite amendment for improving transport resistance to gases. Thus, PolyMet’s proposed use of bentonite as a means to isolate the contents of the tailings impoundment from oxygen will be ineffectual. Consequently, oxygen, as a terminal electron acceptor for the sulfide to sulfate conversion process, will be present in the tailings impoundment. Infiltrating precipitation will contact the contents of the tailings impoundment and produce toxic ARD leachate.']"

Rather than using PolyMet-specific information, estimates were based on industry costs drawn from InfoMine. Foth provides separate InfoMine estimates for mine capital costs and processing plant capital costs. The Foth 2012 report estimated mine capital costs at 7500 tons per day at $125 million for room-and-pillar mining without backfill (adding 20 percent gives $150 million) and $115 million for long-hole stoping with sand backfill (adding 20 percent gives $138 million).46 For the processing plant, Foth 2012 provides an InfoMine estimate for a three-concentrate flotation mill of $98 million at the 7500 tons-per-day level, which Foth adopts as its estimated processing plant cost.47 However, PolyMet provides an estimate of its own processing plant at 32,000 tons per day, which is $63 million.48 The significantly lower cost is the primary savings that PolyMet will achieve by using an existing processing plant. Again there are scaling considerations; the total capital cost at 7500 tons-per-day should be lower than the cost at 32,000 tons per day. However, again solely for the purpose of this discussion we will use the $63 million estimate. Foth also added a contingency amount of approximately 10 percent to the mine and process plant capital costs to calculate the total capital costs.49 Adding 10 percent contingency gives a total capital cost of $234 million for long-hole stoping. This is in comparison to a $250 million estimate used by Foth and the Co-lead agencies.', 'For mining costs, the Foth 2012 report provides cost estimates for both room-and-pillar mining and long-hole open stoping. Many of the estimates did not include cemented backfill, although Foth states “Cemented backfill typically represents roughly 20 percent of mining costs.”31 The report settles on a mining cost of $40 per ton for the 5000 tons-per-day scenario. This amount is significantly higher than any estimate from any source used in the Foth 2012 report. The only source that estimates mining costs above $30 per ton for the 5000 tons-per-day scenario is the AGP Memo, which Foth reports as $44 to $52 at 5000 tons per day for long-hole stoping.32 However, the AGP Memo provides this figure for total operating costs (including processing and administrative),33 while the Foth 2012 report uses it for mining costs only. The Foth 2012 analysis then goes on to add processing and administrative costs again to reach a total operating cost, which doubles the estimated processing and administrative costs included in the total operating cost estimate.', 'Using its $40-per-ton estimate for the 5000 ton-per-day scenario, Foth estimated $33-per-ton for a 7500 ton-per-day scenario. This amounts to a 17.5 percent reduction. Using the same percentage reduction for the maximum cost estimate from any source ($33.50, the maximum amount in the AGP memo) gives a figure of $27.64 per ton. Once again, in the context of eliminating an alternative from NEPA review based on economics, the lower (or at least average) cost estimates should be used, and this estimate is still on the high end of the various figures given by Foth 2012. We also point out that AGP does not provide a basis for its estimates; as far as we can tell, there is no support for its estimates in the record. Nonetheless, for the sole purpose of showing that the economic analysis included in the FEIS does not indicate an operating loss for at least one scenario, we will use $27.64 as an estimated mining cost. The second of the three categories of costs included in total operating costs is processing costs. Foth adopts the InfoMine processing cost for a three-concentrate flotation mill of $13 per ton at 5000 tons per day, after noting comparable values at Copperwood in Michigan ($11.75 per ton) and Lac des Iles in Thunder Bay ($14 per ton). It goes on to scale this to $12.50 per ton for the 7500 tons-per-day level. Remarkably, the report ignores PolyMet’s own processing cost estimate for processing ore from the open pit, which is $6.99 per ton.42 We were unable to extrapolate this to a smaller operation because of unknown scaling factors, but would expect this to be considered in a legitimate economic analysis. The last of the three categories of operating costs is administrative costs. Because different mines label this category differently, it is difficult to compare the numbers from various sources. Foth does not provide an InfoMine estimate for this cost. The examples provided include $3.30 for general and $2.00 for contingency per ton at Lac des Iles (presumably for a total of $5.30 per ton); and $3.35 per ton for general and administrative at Copperwood. The report settles on an estimate of $3.50 per ton.43 This cost apparently does not change based on tonnage; the same cost-per-ton is used in all scenarios. Again, the report completely ignores PolyMet-specific information, which estimates “general and administrative” cost for the open pit mine at $0.66 per ton. Using the numbers discussed above, Foth 2012 reaches a total of $56.50 per ton for total operating costs at the 5000 ton-per-day level, and $49 per ton at the 7500 ton-per-day level. Based on the above discussion, these estimates are clearly inflated. Even if the processing and administrative costs are not adjusted based on PolyMet’s own estimates, and the only correction made is for the discrepancy in the AGP figures, the estimate at the 7500 ton-per-day level would be $42.64.']"
