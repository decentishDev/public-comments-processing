Issue,Count,Summary
WAT,1001,"Part of my coursework concerns water sustainability, and the construction of this mine would jeopardize some of the most important water systems in North America. Lake Superior, with 10% of the world's fresh water, must be preserved at all cost. The water filled NE Minnesota is a sitting duck for contamination. No amount of profit could justify the risk."
GEN,846,"I am against the nickel sulfide mining project in any form whatsoever. I am deeply concerned about this project; 1- potential negative environmental impacts Any risk to the natural resources of northern Minnesota is unacceptable. Please remove me from your Mailing list, which I have no idea how I got on in the first place."
SO,325,"This mine that promises to provide 350 jobs for twenty years has no place jeopardizing the thriving tourism-based economy that sustains 18,000 jobs annually. The long-term costs (potential and actual) to the State of MN are far greater than any projected economic gain. All the jobs will be temporary except for the pollution clean-up jobs that will go on forever. Our wildlands are far too precious to take such risks."
FIN,263,"The environment will eventually be polluted by the NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange Project. The project may meet the State of Minnesota's legal requirements, but these requirements are not sufficient to maintain the integrity of the environment. If the project goes forward the developers, investors and other groups should back environmental cleanup with the entirety of their corporate and personal assets. Failure to do this should stop the project."
PER,231,"The engineering firm that will be the lead for PolyMet Copper Nickel Mine to design and build its tailings dikes was also the designer for the failed Mt. Polley Imperial Metals Copper-Gold Mine of British Columbia, Canada. ""I don't see any consistent mechanisms laid out in the plan to ensure that safety and regulation, and water cleaning will continue unhindered for such a long, long period of time,"" says author."
NEPA,209,"After reading the changes to the most recent Environmental Impact Statement concerning Polymet's proposed copper- nickel mine, I'd like to express my complete opposition to the mine. I I want this very serious concern and complaint documented on the process used for public comment on the EIS for the proposed suffide mine by Polymet. How can the DNR expect anyone, let alone the lay citizenry (including myself) to review a 3,000 plus study and comment on it within 30 days?"
ALT,165,"Common sense says this project should never have been pursued in the first place. The area is revered by thousands, if not millions, of people from all over the world. This isn't the only place in our country where these metals can be found. It is my understanding that returning the area affected by the mining operations to its full, natural state is also an option."
WET,149,"Copper mining in such a valuable wetland area will permanently harm this valuable resource that we hold dear to us, including Lake Superior. The mine will destroy nearly 1,000 acres of high-quality wetlands many of which have already been lost to mining. There is no plan to compensate for the thousands of acres of direct and indirect impacts to high quality wetlands."
PD,148,"There is plenty of copper in the world as is. Do you expect the public to make a reasonable decision without even seeing what you are selling? How about an artist's concept of the finished product? Please require maps and sections showing grade and thickness at the diamond drill holes. Please include in project documentation, the planned dissolution of the site."
MERC,132,"10 percent of babies born along the North Shore of Lake Superior have high levels of mercury in their blood, potentially impacting brain development. The operation of a copper-nickel sulfide mine in northeast Minnesota would greatly contribute to the mercury/sulfate load that is already creating a problem in the St. Louis River."
O,132,I support the current PolyMet NorthMet copper-nickel sulfide mine proposal. I do not object to the U.S. Forest Service proposal to exchange Superior National Forest land for the PolyMet proposal. The PolyMet FEIS is adequate under federal and state laws and regulations. I strongly support the proposed NorthMet Mining Project Land Exchange.
MEPA,105,"The Polymet NorthMet sulfide mining proposal and the Final EIS is inadequate to guarantee environmental safety or long-term economic advantage. The final EIS covers every foreseeable scenario. Polymet has proven they can mine the Northmet site, while being sensitive to the surrounding environment."
HU,94,"I am very concerned that this sulfide mine would affect drinking water and fish and lead to the negative impact of methylmercury on the developing brains of babies and young children. Already I hear stories of large numbers of children living in northern MN having to be treated for heavy metal poisoning, that is only available through a hospital, at great unsupported cost to the families. These, I have heard, already live at a low income level, on reservation land."
LAN,92,"The U.S. Forest Service proposal to exchange Superior National Forest land for the PolyMet proposal should never happen. The exchange is in no way a replacement, but a ""feel good"" trade of numbers/acreage which does not hold the same ecological, environmental benefits to habitat that being part of a larger whole does. Dicing up the national forest, contaminating the mining adjacent land and waters with poisonous sulfide will have serious ramifications."
CUM,83,"I grew up in the northwoods of Minnesota, about 25 miles southeast of Walker. What has happened, and continues to happen, to that area is an atrocity. The cumulative effects of this type of development on the Superior National Forest were not studied by the DNR. Hard, scientific facts have been ignored."
GT,78,PolyMet proposes storing billions of gallons of toxic mine waste behind a forty year old leaky dam. PolyMet simply asserts that the chances of such a failure are too remote to even be considered in the EIS. The integrity of the dams appears breached or breachable. No reinforcement with cement pillars has been proposed for this area.
AIR,72,Mining is already one of the biggest users of electricity in Minnesota. Added mining and processing will increase this. Is this the right time for increasing Minnesota’s carbon footprint when the world is battling its disastrous effects? Does Polymet have a plan for being carbon neutral? Polymet needs a plan in its FEIS for the fossil fuels that will be burned.
WI,61,"The mine will destroy two square miles of designated critical habitat for Canada lynx and wolves. The EIS itself recognizes that the loss of wetlands habitat in the two affected watersheds will occur. I acknowledge that mining has brought Minnesota jobs and some amount of prosperity, but this expansion of that industry is at the risk of our environmental integrity."
CR,59,"Virgil D Sohm is an enrolled member of the Lake Superior Band of Ojibwe, a federally recognized tribal government. Under the Treaty of 1854 recognized as Federal Law, you are not entitled to interfere with our usufructuary rights to hunt, fish and gather our foods and medicines. We have a responsibility as stewards of the land to protect our land for our children and grand children to the 7th Generation."
ROD,39,"The USFS should reject the proposed exchange of Superior National Forest lands for the PolyMet project. The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers should deny any Section 404 permit that would allow PolyMet discharge to pollute wetlands and public waters. The and exchange is not in the public interest, and will harm endangered species, impair downstream tribal resources."
WILD,24,"Northern Minnesota is a jewel in the crown of the state with the Boundary Waters and just the total wildness of the place. We need these wild places to stay as pristine as possible not just for us but for the flora and fauna that thrive there as well as for future generations. The protection of wilderness is integral to maintaining biodiversity and preserving something that has a deep, intrinsic value."
VEG,22,"My primary concern is enviornmental pollution. Look at what has happened around the mines in Canada. Trees are dead for a 20 mile radius down wind. Sulfides attack wild rice roots, destroying entire wild rice beds. Please better analyze impact on threatened species and better protect wild rice habitats."
AQ,21,The FEIS has not rectified the deficiencies previously raised by WaterLegacy regarding impacts on aquatic life resulting from polluted seepage and discharge. Multiple studies have been done that show conclusively that biota in the downstream habitat cannot withstand the stresses of Acid Mine Drainage. The FEIS provides limited and inadequate baseline information on macroinvertebrate populations.
COE,18,"No Clean Water Act Section 404 permit should be issued for the proposed mine. The mine would degrade groundwater and surface water, there is no plan to compensate for the huge impacts to high quality wetlands. PolyMet’s proposed mitigation is insufficient and inadequate for the scale of wetland destruction they propose. The application here does not satisfy those requirements and must be denied."
HAZ,16,"The FEIS is in my experienced opinion, incomplete in its failure to fully evaluate background contamination both known now and that might become evident in the future. The FEIS identifies 29 Areas of Concern (AOCs) that are now PolyMet’s legal responsibility, but still does not provide the necessary clarity about the status of remedial investigations and/or actions necessary to clean up the contamination that occurred over decades of taconite mining and processing."
LU,15,"I stand with the Duluth Downstream Coalition of businesses in their opposition to any hard metal mining on the North Shore of Minnesota, as well as the countless Outdoor Recreation businesses in around the Boundary Waters that oppose development like this around their homes. My family are campers, hunters, and fishermen. Our lakes and streams are suffering already. We can't afford to risk damaging them further."
EDIT,3,"I hope that the MDNR has the capacity to modify the ‘passive voice constructions’ in this FEIS to an active voice in the subsequent permitting process. Not defining who monitors, or how often results in failure to fund monitoring to assure that the potential compliance to state law becomes a certainty."
N,3,"Some distances and directions within the SDEIS appear to be inacurate. The tribal cooperating agencies believe it is indefensible to conclude that, amidst a “mining district” with multiple active mine facilities operating in close proximity, that there is no cumulative effect of heavy industrial and blasting noise on sensitive wildlife and on traditional cultural practices."
