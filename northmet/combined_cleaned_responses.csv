Mark,"The environment will eventually be polluted by the NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange Project. The project may meet the State of Minnesota's legal requirements, but these requirements are not sufficient to maintain the integrity of the environment. If the project goes forward the developers, investors and other groups benefiting from the project should back environmental cleanup with the entirety of their corporate and personal assets. Failure to do this should stop the project.

Mark Roalson,"1. While the FEIS claims PolyMet will treat contaminated water for as long as it takes to keep that water from polluting the environment (during operation and after plant closing), there is no Minnesota mining precedent or model of this ""after treatment"". As a matter of fact, a recent article in the newspaper Timber Jay brings out the fact that mining companies are incapable of doing this. During the existence of the old LTV mine, copper ore was dug up along with taconite in the Dunka Pit, (now owned and monitored by Cleveland Cliffs and their contractors). Sulfate and heavy metal runoff was supposed to be mitigated by the operation of water treatment systems",PD,NS,X,1,
Mark Roalson,"That particular set of equipment is NOT running at the present time, although it is supposed to be in operation. There have been several documented aquatic life kills in the Dunka watershed and Birch Lake into which it drains. Contractors ""monitor"" this drainage but there is no enforcement of the water standards. This tells me that the DNR, EPA, MPCA and any other governmental agency chartered to prevent water pollution is incapable of doing this. Enforcement is non-existent. Cleveland Cliffs is only charged with ""monitoring"", not treatment. What assurance does the public have that this will not happen again with PolyMet? None.",PER,NS,X,1,
Mark Roalson,"By court order the mine has sunk two cleanup wells and brings up dirty water and runs it through two reverse osmosis plants to purify dirty water into potable water. 80% of all water can be recovered as usable. 20% of all water is left as an unusable, unmarketable brine of sulfate and heavy metals that has to be stockpiled at the mine site.

The two principals involved in the fraud, as at PolyMet, were Mr Cherry, then Project Manager, and Mr Donahue of Foth Engineering who, to quote him, ""Knows how to get permits"". We still have the evidence. It is significant that Kennecott never denied wrongdoing. In court they would stroke their mustaches thoughtfully and change the subject. We allowed them to do that. Everything was under control. A ""Done Deal"". The EPA had earlier delegated power to MDEQ to handle all mining regulation in Michigan, without having mining expertise, but they ignored real expert advice and handed out the permits. One item stands out very clearly: Our experts easily recognized lack of expertise and manipulation of data fed into mine design, which led to mine design with safety factors lower than one, indicating that the structure, as planned, is likely to collapse. They simply denied it, without evidence. The judge took a nap. That matter is now in the hands of MSHA (responsible for underground mine safety and health) but they too appear to have been enlisted and compromised, despite Director Joe Main's vow to eliminate all ""Sudden and Unexpected Mine Collapses"". I remind them every month or two but they have implemented Joe Main's vow by ""Talking to Lundin, the current owner/operator, who says that there is no problem."" As did the fox in the henhouse. According to Michigan Mining Law, Part 632, pp 14-16 they - and all persons having knowledge of the deceptions - are felons and are subject to stiff penalties - more so now that lives are knowingly endangered.

Who is going to be responsible for actually enforcing these regulations? The leaking Dunka Pit has no water purification equipment running as per stated in law. No one is enforcing regulations there.

Today the public bears the financial burden of the chemicals leaching into the surrounding ground.

While not openly admitted by the mining companies, bankruptcy is a central part of their business model. Most importantly, I consider it to be absolutely immoral to allow any mining action that will require our children and grandchildren, and potentially generations after them, to pay the price for cleanup. We have a moral responsibility to give the next generation a world that is equal to, if not better, than the one we inherited from our parents. If PolyMet NorthMet are allowed, we will be giving our children and grandchildren a polluted and damaged northern Minnesota. That we cannot allow. No amount of money earned by the owners of the mining companies and mine workers can justify that damage or compensate future generations for their loss.",FIN,NS,X,1,
John Roth,"The proposed mines are simply not needed and prudent, conservative resource management dictates that the minerals should be left in the ground and extracted only if needed by future generations and the environmental risks can be eliminated. The reason why the mines are not needed is that there is no shortage of copper and nickel. According to the International Copper Association and the U.S. Geological Survey, ""Since 1950 ... there has always been, on average, around 40 years of copper reserves (which are defined as 'deposits that have been discovered, evaluated and assessed to be economically profitable') and over 200 years of resources left."" Resources are defined to ""include reserves, discovered deposits which are potentially profitable and undiscovered deposits that are predicted based on preliminary geological surveys."" The U.S. Geological Survey further reported in its February 2014 Mineral Commodity Summary that ""The International Copper Study Group predicted that global refined copper production in 2013 would exceed demand by about 390,000 tons."" It went on to state that ""Global production of refined copper was projected to increase by 3.9% and consumption was projected to remain essentially unchanged."" In another report issued on March 6, 2014, the U.S. Geological Survey stated that ""geologically-based global assessment of undiscovered copper resources estimated that 3.5 billion metric tons of copper may exist worldwide."" PolyMet's website says that they estimate 275 million tons of reserves and 694 million tons of resources - a tiny fraction of what the U.S. Geological Survey estimates may be available. What is important to note, as well, is that ""copper is one of the few raw materials which can be recycled repeatedly without any loss of performance."" (International Copper Association) If the recycling of copper already in the waste stream, or slated for it in the future, could be increased, it would significantly reduce the need for newly refined copper. At present, the U.S. Geological Survey states that ""about 32% of the U.S. copper supply"" comes from recycled copper. Each year, however, we recycle only a fraction of the waste copper available. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that the U.S. generated 3.412 million tons of e-waste (waste from old computers, cell phone, TVs, wires and other electrical items) in 2012. We recycled only 29.2% of it. The EPA also estimated that there are probably 100 million old TVs in storage, resting in people's closets and basements, ready to be thrown out. And that doesn't include the number of old computers, printer, phones and other devises. Clearly there is a huge potential for increased recycling, and the value of that recycled material exceeds the value of newly refined metal. According to the United Nations University (September 17, 2009), ""A ton of used mobile phones ... - or approximately 6,000 handsets (a tiny fraction of today's 1 billion annual production) - contains about 3.5 kilograms of silver, 340 grams of gold, 140 grams of palladium and 130 kg of copper ... The average mobile phone battery contains another 3.5 grams of copper. Combined value: over US$15,000 at today's prices."" On July 11, 2014 the COMEX spot copper price for newly refined copper was $3.27 per pound. The price for copper scrap was $3.021 per pound. And that price does not factor in the enormous benefits achieved by recycling, such as the reduced pollution and costs of landfills. Accordingly, when there is excess production of newly refined copper and large supplies of scrap, why would any prudent steward of our natural resources allow environmentally risky and highly expensive mining to occur? It doesn't make economic sense. We should save the resource for our children and future generations.",NEPA,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme NEPA 06

The PolyMet FEIS is adequate under federal and state laws and regulations because: - It succeeds to evaluate pollution risks to drinking water, fish, wild rice and human health using realistic assumptions about how much polluted seepage will be captured and treated during operations, reclamation, and closure. - It succeeds to analyze health risks and impacts on children, workers and communities who rely on fish and wild rice for subsistence, including risks from asbestos-like particles and methylmercury. - It does evaluate the impacts of polluted seepage north of the mine site on the 100 Mile Swamp and the Rainy River (Boundary Waters area) Basin. - It succeeds to adequately consider alternatives to minimize environmental harm, reduce polluted seepage from unlined permanent waste facilities, mitigate wetlands destruction, and reduce the threat of catastrophic dam failure. I do not object to the proposed NorthMet Mining Project Land Exchange in the Superior National Forest because: - It does not conflict with federal policy to protect wetlands, resulting in direct destruction of 913 acres of wetlands and destruction or impairment of up to 8,264 acres of wetlands. - It would not degrade surface and groundwater, violating the Superior National Forest plan and state, federal and tribal water quality standards. - It would not harm endangered, threatened and species of concern, including the northern goshawk, great gray owl, lynx and moose. - It is in the public interest, would not impair tribal resources, and would not result in a loss of ecological services.",O,NS,X,1,

We do have mines in northern Minnesota and many of these communities don't seem very prosperous. Not as prosperous as mining proponents would lead you to believe. I'm willing to bet Ely's future on a pristine area of Resorts and wilderness over growth and mining. Let's look out 50 or even 100 years like our leaders of the past were willing to do. As the population of the planet grows there will be fewer and fewer areas like the arrowhead region left. The kind of Mining proposed for the Ely area has a lousy track record.

The few jobs that would be provided by a copper-nickel mine could destroy just as many jobs by damaging an environment that must remain pristine in order to support a vibrant tourism industry, and in order to provide clean drinking water, edible fish, safe swimming, and non-toxic soil to support food plants and natural ecosystems.

As a former canoe guide in the Boundary Waters and Quetico; as someone already concerned about toxins in Minnesota fish that I would like to eat; as someone acutely aware of how much I depend on a clean, healthy environment for my well-being, and as a daily user of copper and nickel in the infrastructure of my life: I object to this mine. We can recycle copper and nickel that have already been mined. We can also find and create alternatives to the ways we use these metals. We can not find an alternative to a clean environment; we cannot continue to poison our life-support system. It has been reported that this mine may create ""some pollution"" that may take 100 years or more to clean up. That is absolutely unacceptable.

Also, pay attention to where the Laurentian Divide is; they have already crossed that line, which should have never happened in the first place. I wish Albert Einstein was here to tell you this, maybe people would get it. He might say, ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.""

KR STOKES,"I am in favor of the current PolyMet NorthMet copper-nickel sulfide mine proposal. The PolyMet Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) is adequate under both federal and state standards; I was glad to see the U.S. Forest Service proposal to exchange Superior National Forest land for the PolyMet proposal; and I support issuing any federal permit allowing PolyMet to begin operations. The PolyMet FEIS is adequate under federal and state laws and regulations because: - It evaluated pollution risks to drinking water, fish, wild rice and human health using realistic assumptions about how much polluted seepage will be captured and treated during operations, reclamation, and closure. - It analyzed health risks and impacts on children, workers and communities who rely on fish and wild rice for subsistence, including risks from asbestos-like particles and methylmercury. - It evaluated the impacts of polluted seepage north of the mine site on the 100 Mile Swamp and the Rainy River (Boundary Waters area) Basin. - It adequately considered alternatives to minimize environmental harm, reduce polluted seepage from unlined permanent waste facilities, mitigate wetlands destruction, and reduce the threat of catastrophic dam failure. I strongly support the proposed NorthMet Mining Project Land Exchange in the Superior National Forest and any federal Clean Water Act permit for PolyMet. I request the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources approve the PolyMet FEIS as adequate; the U.S. Forest Service support the proposed exchange of Superior National Forest lands for the PolyMet project; and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency support and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approve any Section 404 permit that would allow PolyMet to operate.",O,NS,X,1,

John Trullinger,"I’m writing in support of the Polymet project. While I am not intricately familiar with all aspects of the EIS, I believe there is a plan in place that is compliant with the laws of the land. If any project comes up with a plan that can meet the law, I am a firm believer that project should be allowed to happen. I trust the government, and I trust that the USACE, the USFS, and the MNDNR have thoroughly reviewed and vetted the plan to the point where they are comfortable with the mine plan. There were tens of thousands of public comments regarding the plan during the draft phases, and the EIS owners were able to address all of these comments. The fact that Polymet, the USACE, USFS, and MNDNR were able to justify and slightly tweak the FEIS following all of these comments, and still want to proceed with the project, leads me to believe they have a viable plan in place. The mine will provide many benefits for the region. It will provide much needed high paying jobs and allow for the iron range to start diversifying the types of minerals it is mining. This will also buy the communities of the iron range additional time to transition into other types of manufacturing to keep these communities viable beyond when the minerals run out. Polymet will provide new taxes and school funds for the state and nation. Proponents argue that copper prices are currently low, and there isn’t much of a demand for it, however, in copper’s case this seems to be more of a short term anomaly rather than a lengthy trend. I’ve read studies where the world’s demand for copper will outlast its’ current mineable reserves in a frighteningly short time period. I am not a fan of the nebulousness of the water treatment period that the EIS proposes at plant closure; however I realize that there will be many unknowns by then including sulfate laws making it difficult to plan for, so I am willing to overlook it and still provide my support for the project. My biggest concern with this project is outside the realm of Environmental impacts. This is a very polarizing proposed project, and short of some unforeseen politics, I believe this project will be permitted. There are good caring people on both sides of the argument. My biggest concern is that the people who are against this project do not trust their government, and do not trust the process, and because of this, they have been forced to resort to ""dirty tricks"" and ""dirty politics"" to try and do anything they can to try and stop the project. After the dust clears, I’d like to see the respective government agencies to do what they can to try and rebuild trust in their government by all. This process has worked, and it has made the project environmentally viable. It has turned a draft EIS that the EPA gave a very poor rating to into a viable final EIS that will safeguard the people of the region while aiding the region's economy.",GEN,NS,X,1,

Please approve polyments final EIS and allow polymet to lead northern Minnesota to a new age of Mining. The Final EIS for PolyMet's proposed mine concludes a thorough and independent review of the project's potential environmental effects. After 10 years of study, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and U.S. Forest Service have looked at the evidence and correctly found that the NorthMet Mine can comply with strict state and federal environmental standards. The Final EIS for the NorthMet Mine is far beyond ""adequate."" It takes a careful and comprehensive look at the project from every angle. - The Co-lead Agencies have spent 10 years evaluating potential project effects and alternatives. - The Final EIS responds in detail to thousands of public comments and questions submitted during the review periods for the Draft EIS and the Supplemental Draft EIS. - The project's water modeling— which was fully updated for the Final EIS—shows that PolyMet's treatment and mitigation plans will prevent acid mine drainage and meet all water quality standards. - After careful review, the Final EIS concludes that groundwater flows from the NorthMet project will not directly, indirectly, or cumulatively affect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness or Voyageurs National Park, and that any possible groundwater flow would be prevented. - The Final EIS also specifically considered the project's potential effects on air quality and water quality with respect to human health, and identified no adverse health risks. - In short, the Final EIS meets all of the requirements of the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

What happens if there is a spill? Can PolyMet afford long term cleanup?

It is extremely shortsighted to downplay the value of the pristine habitat and wealth of clean fresh water that our state holds. As our world continues on its consumption trajectory at greater and greater speeds, more and more resources will be tapped, more of the natural world violated by oil spills, chemical leaks, mining runoff, etc etc. When all the clean corners of the planet are polluted, when the west coast hasn't seen rain in 20 years, when we're having a hard time growing enough food to feed our nation, when fresh water from the ground is a rare delicacy, our state could be the crown jewel source of vitality. water brings life. and we have so much of it. nature brings healing to humans, and we have so much raw beautiful powerful nature that can help us - if we let it.

Russ Mattson,"We are asked to decide what is the best for our communities. That of course is loosely interpreting the governor. But there is a bigger question here. The issue presented, by some, is the choice between economic development, good jobs and the environment and health. To frame the choice as correct or incorrect, right or wrong is simplistic. The question, as are all policy questions, is not so clear as it would first appear. Is the choice between employment and fresh air and clean water? Is it that simple. Maybe the question should be turned around. Can you have a clean green environment and healthy individuals and communities without good jobs, without concerned families, and an engaged community? And would it matter if the environment was clean and green but no community? Sort of a nature park or zoological exhibit? Can you have a productive stable economy with opportunity for our children and their children without both? I suggest that the environment is not so narrow as some would make it to be. A stable economy builds communities, families, futures and ensures that all benefit, not only the environment of the community, and families, but the health of the people and that of the physical environment and ecosystems. Much concern is voiced about the potential for pollution from the mine. But lets take a closer look at our environment. The mine proper would encompass less than 1000 acres of mostly previously mined land. The Mining would reuse an existing tailings basin and utilize state of the art pollution prevention in the entire process. It would produce mainly Copper, Nickel and lesser amounts of Cobalt, Silver, Platinum, Palladium and Gold. By contrast Farming/Agriculture in Minnesota (per farmlandinfo.org) covers 40,000 (25,600,000 acres) square miles of Minnesota. And almost 1,450,000 square miles in the entire US. In the process farming has a tremendous impact on the environment. This industry applies more than 8.91 million tons of minerals(from the USDA), such as potash and phosphorus to this land. Both of which are mined. Neither of which are easily recycled, unless one removes these elements from the ocean in which they end. 80% and 30% of the Potash and Phosphate(Phosphorus) respectively are imported. These totals do not include the nitrogen injected into the soil coaxed out of the atmosphere by the Huber-Bosch process with the use of natural gas. This amount is an amazing 12.89 million tons. 50% of the nitrogen fertilizer, as well, is imported. In addition there are other additives, chemicals, such as; herbicides, fungicides, pesticides which control or kill; pests, molds, insects, bacteria, viruses. Approximately 76 million pounds of Atrazine and Endosulfan(from the EPA and CDC), in round numbers, are applied to the land and crops. In the process of Farming/Agriculture much of what is added finds its way via erosion the Mississippi into the ocean as indicated previously. As well this industry, Farming/Agriculture has caused to be removed via erosion several cubic miles of topsoil, with any of the remaining additives in that topsoil. This mix of topsoil, fertilizers and pesticides also finds its way to the ocean. This industry, Farming/Agriculture farming uses in planting, harvesting, transport, processing and packaging about 15% of all the petroleum products consumed in the US. This summary does not include the potential impact of genetically modified products which have been planted on this same land, or the known impairment of aquifers, lakes and rivers by Farming/Agriculture in the state of Minnesota. In comparison any copper nickel mining of whatever extent would cover less than 1/1,000,000 th of the land surface covered by that of Farming/Agriculture. As well the Mining places no additives on or in the soil. No herbicides, no pesticides, no chemicals. Are we missing something here? Is the wrong industry being monitored? Of course we want food and the products that come from Farming/Agriculture. We want the products from the farm and we use the products every day from Mining. We all want the iconic farmland of Minnesota. But we could get those products from elsewhere; (as well do with many critical metals and minerals) Chile, New Zealand, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, or Europe and let others deal with impacts. This is even more curious when we look at where these metals, copper, nickel, palladium and gold are used: Cell Phones, Flat Screen TVs, Solar Panels, Wind Farms and Electric Cars In particular each cell phone, of which there are over 100,000,000 in the United States, use .572 oz. of copper, .01 oz. of silver, .001 oz. of gold and .0005 oz. of palladium (from Electronic Recyclers). Multiply that by 100,000,000 and we see a substantial amount of these metals. For a typical 2.5MW Wind Turbine more than 1200 pounds of copper(from copper.org), and slightly more for a Solar Farm with a similar capacity. And electric car such as a Prius? About 64 pounds of copper and 22 to 32 pounds of nickel depending on which source one uses. (Not to mention the rare earth metals used by both the cell phone and electric vehicle.) Some of these metals are recyclable, such as copper. 44% of the copper used in the United States is recycled copper. Today there is no practical way to recycle the minerals used in Farming/Agriculture; Potassium and Phosphorus. No one is so out of touch as to suggest seriously outsourcing farming. Hopefully the same can be said of mining these essential metals. Mining is not old fashioned, out of date, or irresponsible of the environment. It is crucial to a modern economy, an absolute necessity. Both industries, Mining and Farming/Agriculture need attention to the processes, need boundaries, need practical regulation and monitoring. We want a community that is viable, stable, healthy and to the greatest extent practical resourceful and self sufficient.",O,NS,X,1,

James Ferstle,"The problem with inflicting environmental damage is once it's done you can't repair it. We argue about climate change, but do very little to address the problem. Jobs trump resource destruction when all at issue is training oneself to do a job, not demand that the job must conform to your ""skills."" America was not built on people demanding work, it was by Americans working to make the country strong, not rolling over to a corporation that wants to minimize their costs and drive up their profits. If it was cheap to mine copper or other ""precious metals"" under the Washington Monument, the White House, etc. in Washington, DC, would we plow under those structures to create jobs to mine there? No, you manage your resources, not go wherever it is easiest or cheapest to get resources that are not vital to anything but a company's bottom line. Mining copper-nickel sulfide at a place, such as the proposed site in Northern Minnesota, is not worth the damage it will do to the area. Create something good for the country instead of stripping the land at a higher cost than any minerals you take out of it. Take a trip around the area and look at what mining has left behind. Pits and waste. Yes, it built great schools, such as Hibbing HS in the era when companies were more responsable and the profits trickled down to education and community, not merely for the carpet bagging practices of today where companies don't care about the community. They promise things that they have no intent on keeping. Use out of work mine workers as a bargaining chip. Spend money bussing them into public meetings, rather than putting money into retraining them so they can have the skills to do something aside from mining for the times when the environment does not need their mining skills. They'll also ship in workers from outside the area, rather than maximize the economic impact on the skilled workers who already reside on the iron range.

On page 36 of the Executive Summary, the FEIS identifies 10 gallons per minute of untreated water to be released during closure from the Mine Site and 20 gallons of untreated water per minute released from the Tailings Basin. That's 43,200 gallons of water per day or about 1.29 million gallons per month.

Wallace,"and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC), one of the cooperating agencies on the decades-long study, Barr Engineering, the PolyMet contractor that actually ran the water flow model used in the study, made fundamental miscalculations, rendering the results of this key element of the environmental study invalid. Barr works as a consultant for PolyMet, yet the lead agencies have relied heavily on its technical work throughout the environmental review process."" ""GLIFWC, which represents 11 Indian bands in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, maintains its own scientific research staff. The agency, based in Odanah, Wis., is the only entity, other than Barr Engineering, which has actually run the MODFLOW model, a highly complex computer program for determining water flow through the environment."" ""Yet, according to GLIFWC, Barr got it wrong when it set the assumptions while calibrating the MODFLOW model, using water levels within the Peter Mitchell pits that were ten meters too high for the time period in question. With the higher water levels used by Barr, the model predicted that--since water flows downhill-- the higher the elevation of the water in the pits, the greater outward pressure and flow of that water towards lower terrain, such as the Partridge River, located just south of the Peter Mitchell pit and adjacent to the proposed PolyMet mine. But if the water level is assumed to be 33 feet lower, as GLIFWC officials maintain was the proper assumption, then the headwaters of the Partridge River would be higher in elevation than the water in the Peter Mitchell pits, and that would reverse the flow of water, and potential contaminants, according to Coleman."" ""Because of this error, the calibration model has the local direction of groundwater flow 180 degrees reversed from the actual conditions during the calibration period,"" states Coleman. Rather than pushing ground and surface water from the Laurentian Divide to the south, lower water levels in the Peter Mitchell pits would essentially move the continental divide to the south and incorporate much of the area surrounding the proposed PolyMet Mine into the Rainy River watershed.""",,,,,

The appraisal process used by the Forest Service does not fully consider the value of future uses of exchanged lands. This should be remedied in the EIS. In a fair exchange Polymet should provide the federal government with total acres that are several multiples of what is presently proposed.

Sec. 2000bb-1(a)(b). The Act defines ""government"" to include any department or agency of the United States (Sec 2000bb-2(1). The United States Forest Service and the Army Corps of Engineers are Departments or Agencies. The least restrictive means standard is exceptionally demanding (see City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532) and cannot be met by the proposal for the NorthMet mine. Mesabe Widjiu[1][1] is an acknowledged ""cultural resource” and is an irretrievable resources under 42 U.S.C. 4332 Sec. 102 (2)(C)(v). As amended by the Religious Land Use Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), the Religious Freedom Restoration Act covers ""any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.' Sec 2000cc-5(7)(A). A Court's ""narrow function...is to determine"" whether the asserted religious belief reflects ""an honest conviction"" (See Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana Employment Security Div. 450 U.S. 707 at 716). The NorthMet mine site is ceded land under the 1854 Treaty Authority. Under NEPA the human environment includes the natural and the physical, and the relationships of people to that environment. The NorthMet Project Proposed Action is considered an undertaking as defined in 36 CFR 800, the regulation implementing Section 106 of the NHPA. The area in which effects on resources are evaluated is the Area of Potential Effect (APE). The APE is defined as, “... the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic properties, if any such properties exist. The area of potential effects is influenced by the scale and nature of the undertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking” (36 CFR § 800.16(d)). Mesabe Widjiu is within the APE of the NorthMet mine. Mesabe Widjiu is a Traditional Cultural Property (TCPs). Beliefs or practices associated with a TCP are of central importance in defining its significance. Mesabe Widjiu is the path of the Thunderbirds. Mesabe Widjiu is a tangible property as defined in National Register Bulletin 38 as a place “eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because of its association with cultural practices or beliefs of a living community that (a) are rooted in that community’s history, and (b) are important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of the community” (National Register Bulletin 38:1). Since Mesabe Widjiu is adversely affected by the NorthMet mine, (see 36 CFR 800.5) the USACE and the USFS must avoid the effect by refusing to permit the land exchange, since the effect cannot be mitigated. The destruction of a section of the Mesabe Widjiu destroys the integrity of the landform and the earth energies and spiritual energies associated with the landform. As a Pagan Druid, I have taken my staff, drum, and pipe and performed ceremony on the Mesabe Widjiu (though not at the overlook at the mine site. I have never been on the proposed mine property) to ensure that the Thunderbirds continue to bring the rains to the Lake Superior/Great Lakes Basin. If this NorthMet mine is allowed to proceed, the Thunderbirds may no longer travel along their traditional path, bringing drought to the land ceded in the 1854 Treaty Authority and to the Superior Basin. Or they may stop at the mine site in their anger and flood everything and not continue on to ThunderBay. This future harm is a physical and quantifiable harm which proceeds directly from the honest spiritual conviction of the Ojibwe and Pagans that the Thunderbirds follow Mesabe Widjiu (see Sec 2000cc-5(7)(A). There is no compelling governmental interest in either the mine itself or the land exchange associated with the NorthMet mine that justifies the destruction of the Mesabe Widjiu. You cannot break the path of the Thunderbirds without spiritual repercussions. The USACE and the USFS both admit that the best feasible alternative to permitting the mine is to maintain the status quo (See FEIS – Chapter 3) and this action must be adopted by the co-lead agencies. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act prohibits you from destroying the irretrievable resource that is the Mesabe Widjiu and from burdening the religious beliefs of the Ojibwe and Pagans. The Thunderbirds follow the Mesabe Widjiu and will alter their path if you destroy this culturally significant landform.",CR,NS,X,1,

Emily Steil,"This EIS is faulty in its assessment of resulting water quality. In chapter three it accepts that the water will need to be treated for an unidentifiable length of time. Next it seems to accept that the water can be treated but says nothing about how long this water will need to be treated. In the press we read it could be a very long time. It then forwards the issue over to the permitting phase to ensure that the water will be treated as long as needed. It assumes that is where the necessary resources will be allocated to treat this water ""forever"" if required. Since the EIS is not able to say at what point the water will be safe it is in fact saying there is a long term unacceptable environmental consequence from this mine. Hiding behind a ""sleight of hand"" statement that passes this issue on to the permitting process reveals a huge inadequacy in the EIS. The EIS is about environmental consequence not about whether there will be the will or resources to permanently and forever sufficiently address water quality. Given all the unknowns that our future holds there is a big chance government will eventually be required to address part or all of the water quality issues from this mine. Or, worse, the resulting water will eventually be not treated at all. It also assumes what we know about water quality today is all we will ever need to consider.",WAT,S,O,8,MDNR et al. 2014b
Emily Steil,"There is a fairly simple solution to this complex issue. This would be that Polymet fills in the west pit with what was taken out at some predetermined point, and covers it, which would end poisoning the water. At present the state has written the agreement with Polymet to allow them access to any minerals under what they presently plan to remove in the west pit. It would seem to be a simple step to get them to commit to a set time to end any more mining on the site. Then the state would have a finite term to monitor water quality, not for an indefinite term as this EIS proposes.",ALT,S,O,4,MDNR et al. 2013b

They have actually proven all the arguments that had been given to kill this project right from the beginning. I think it is time for all the decision makers to stand up and do the right thing and put an end to this proposed project before an environmental disaster occurs. An environmental disaster that could not be fixed, there would be no second chance or reconsidering.

Those, and other processes would result in contaminant concentrations decreasing with time and distance from the source."" It is hard for me to believe this project can be done safely when there is acknowledgement of the contaminants being leaked. Despite contaminants being purportedly diminished and degraded as they leak away from the source, the contaminants have still entered the environment, many of them heavy metals, that will not break down for hundreds of years.

Allen Frechette,"The FEIS is in my experienced opinion, incomplete in its failure to fully evaluate background contamination both known now and that which might become evident in the future as a direct result of preexisting conditions from identified Areas of Concern (AOCs).

SDEIS COOP Response #2984"
Allen Frechette,"Also, establishing the amount of financial assurance that Polymet will have to provide in advance of obtaining permits to cover both the preexisting AOCs that they have accepted responsibility for and those that might become evident in the future appears from the findings in the FEIS to be premature. Polymet could claim future discovered contamination, which the State alleges is Polymet's responsibility, is not their responsibility, but rather from a preexisting AOC that had not been adequately evaluated by the state. The FEIS actually acknowledges this possibility and provides Polymet an established position for denial of future responsibility for contamination.",FIN,NS,X,1,
Allen Frechette,"Establishment of responsibility for preexisting ground water contamination must be addressed before a permit for Polymet can be granted, to eliminate the potential for legal problems associated with assignment of responsibility for subsequent ground water contamination should Polymet proceed. It is reasonable to assume that any claim by the state for access to financial assurance from Polymet will be challenged if Polymet can argue that such contamination is the result of preexisting conditions. This issue has been established as legitimate in previous permit considerations by the MPCA where applications for permits have been submitted in areas with preexisting contamination concerns that could complicate assignment of responsibility for contamination to the proposed project. (One example is the former Pollution Controls Incorporated (PCI) site in Scott County, where the deed for the site was even written by the MPCA's AG to exclude future development.) There are only two ways to resolve this problem – either Polymet must agree to full responsibility without the right to challenge the State's decision, for any actionable contamination found subsequent to their operation regardless of original source that is deemed by the State to be associated with their operations, or Polymet must agree to be responsible for proving to the satisfaction of the state that discovered contamination is not from their project. Both of these options are unlikely to be acceptable to Polymet. In the absence of a resolution to this issue, the FEIS must be found incomplete until all AOCs potentially complicating future assignment of responsibility for contamination can be fully examined and addressed.",FIN,NS,X,1,
Allen Frechette,"The amount of financial assurance necessary to ensure sufficient funds to address the future costs of site reclamation, ongoing monitoring and potential mitigation in response to contamination discovered through the monitoring has yet to be determined. The FEIS acknowledges that the details needed for this assessment can only be determined with additional technical information normally provided during subsequent permitting. However, Polymet should have provided the necessary engineering details for this critical issue as part of the EIS. Thus until the issue of existing AOCs and their relevance in complicating existing and future contamination discovery, which could be associated with the Polymet proposal, is addressed, this remains an unresolved issue, which could also complicate future regulation of Polymet should a permit be issued.",PER,NS,X,1,
Allen Frechette,"A Project Proposer chooses the project site and as noted in the EIS alternatives discussion, there were no alternative sites or technologies that would satisfy the needs of the Project Proposer. With a chosen site come the preexisting assets and liabilities associated with that chosen site. Polymet appears willing to accept some of the liabilities, but in the absence of a better understanding of the preexisting AOCs, it is likely the state would be responsible for addressing contamination from both existing AOCs and those that Polymet alleges were from existing AOCs in the absence of state funded investigation to prove otherwise.",FIN,NS,X,1,
Allen Frechette,"Polymet is a Limited Liability Corporation, with (at this point) financial resources that have been questioned. The proposed transaction and affiliated private agreements appear to transfer responsibility for existing contaminated properties to Polymet. As the FEIS notes (see sections below) transfer of financial responsibility from previous mining sites to Polymet appear to (should Polymet fail) result in removing responsible parties currently (apparently) cooperating with the State for remediation and transfer them to Polymet. The issue of the necessary financial assurance prudent to be required by the state appears to have not been resolved in the responses to comments on this issue presented in the FEIS. Thus, this remains an unresolved issue rendering the FEIS incomplete, or if unresolvable, cause for permit denial.",FIN,NS,X,1,
Allen Frechette,"The FEIS appears to acknowledge the unresolved issues related to establishing appropriate financial assurance for the Polymet proposed project but fails to actually provide sufficient illumination to those who would rule on the permits, set the amount of financial assurance and land swaps associated with this project. As a result, the FEIS remains incomplete in my opinion. It is arguable that the effort and cost of fully resolving this important concern is beyond the scope of an EIS, and it may be so. However, in that case, this issue should be emphasized and carefully explained to subsequent decision makers so that they understand the associated risks to the State and rule appropriately. The purpose of an EIS is after all simply to illuminate the potential impacts and risks associated with the evaluated proposed project and provide the project proposer an opportunity to agree to applicable mitigation. It thus becomes the responsibility of the State staff charged with preparation of an environmental review document to effectively convey the findings to the decision makers. Because of the immensity of the documents associated with this EIS, it would be inappropriate for responsible staff to assume that decision makers would be able to read through all the complicated technical documents to obtain an appropriate level of understanding to make responsibly informed decisions. Therefore, I believe it would be of value for the technical staff from the DNR, MPCA, MDH, U. S.

After more than 10 years of study to assess whether copper mining will cause permanent damage to our environment, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and U.S. Forest Service have found that the NorthMet Mine can comply with strict state and federal environmental standards to be a supplier of strategic metals for the good of all of us.

David Baldus,Although I am just finishing my undergraduate degree in geology at a liberal arts college I find it easy to conclude and defend the stance that there is not adequate knowledge of how groundwater will interact with the fractured bedrock at and around the mine to claim that contamination of the surrounding watershed is not likely.,WAT,S,O,2,"SDEIS Themes WR 010, WR 007"
David Baldus,"It has been widely suggested that the upper layer of crystalline bedrock aquifers tends to exhibit more fractures and a higher propensity for groundwater movement. In the case of the proposed NorthMet sulfide mine in Northern Minnesota this fractured layer is of vital importance in modeling potential groundwater contamination. The groundwater flow properties of this upper-fissured layer of the Duluth Complex are poorly understood and characterized. This study models the flow of contaminated groundwater through this layer from the West Mine Pit to the Partridge River. Based on the wide range of results and their indication of likely contamination in the Partridge River; I suggest that acid mine drainage from the NorthMet cite to the Partridge River is a pressing concern and the hydraulic properties (Hydraulic conductivity, porosity, and thickness) of fissured layer of the Duluth Complex are key factors in modeling this situation, which deserve refined characterization and investigation",WAT,S,O,2,"SDEIS Themes WR 007, WR 011"
David Baldus,This contamination would take the form of acid mine drainage. As the sulfide mining occurs large piles of waste rock would be generated. This waste rock will contain elevated levels of sulfide minerals. If left at the surface in contact with water and oxygen these sulfide minerals will oxidize to sulfates and produce highly acidic solutions referred to as acid drainage (Lefticariu 2009).,WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 001
David Baldus,"The idea behind filling the pits with water is that the pits will then become anoxic preventing the oxidation of the sulfide minerals and creation of acid mine drainage. While in principle this is true, if the pits overflow or more relevantly leak into the substrate oxidation could occur and produce acid mine drainage.",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 002
David Baldus,"Crystalline bedrock has a very low primary permeability and porosity almost all groundwater movement through them occurs through fractures, faults and joints (secondary permeability and porosity). Due to this property; PolyMet argues that the likelihood of groundwater leakage from their pit is low (Cite). However the literature suggests the upper portion of Hard Rock Aquifers tend to be highly fractured and viable for ground water movement (Lachassagne 2011). I will suggest that groundwater leakage through the upper fractured portion of the Duluth Complex and the overlying unconsolidated deposits from the West Pit to the Partridge River in indeed a reason for concern.",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 011
David Baldus,"PolyMet claims at the fracture flow is largely irrelevant in the Duluth complex due to the fact that fracture causing tectonic event predate the intrusion of the Duluth complex (POLYMET 2013 pg3 ->Farvolden et al. 1988; Douglas et al. 2000; Rouleau et al. 2003). However the literature suggests that fracture permeability of Hard Rock Aquifers is not due solely to unloading and tectonics but the weathering of the surficial layers of near surface crystalline bedrock (Lachassagne 2011). Lachassagne et al. (2011) describe a “fissured layer” residing at the bottom of the unconsolidated weathering profile directly above the un-weathered fresh bedrock that has that has relatively high permeability. According to Figure 1 from Arcworth, 1987 this zone may be anywhere from one to twenty meters thick (3.28-65.67 feet). Citing data from Maréchal et al., and Dewandel et al., 2006 they report hydraulic conductivity values of up to 2.83 feet per day. In the model, groundwater leakage from the NorthMet Mine Site flow through the upper fractured portion of crystalline bedrock is highly relevant. The Duluth Complex is close to the surface and exposed in many locations thus susceptible to weathering and the creation of the discussed “fissured layer”(cite). Groundwater flow will likely be concentrated in this fissured layer because of the relative lack of permeability elsewhere in the bedrock substrate.",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 011
David Baldus,"I will use two values for hydraulic conductivity of the “fissured layer” in this model: the highest reported value (28.3 feet per day), the lowest value (2.83x10-2 feet per day). These values will represent best, worst-case scenarios.",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 009
David Baldus,"Wood et al. (1993) found porosities of 1.5% in the fractured bedrock at the Mirror Lake site, also used by Day-Lewis et al. (2000). Caine and Tomusiak. (2003) report values as high as 2.78% in a fractured crystalline bedrock aquifer system in the Front Range of the Rockies. The Front Range site is likely also heavily altered by faulting and mountain building but having the highest porosity value found in the literature for fractured crystalline bedrock aquifers it will be used to calculate a best- case scenario. The Wood et al., 1993 porosity value will be used to simulate a worst-case scenario model as it setting is the most similar to the NorthMet site.",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 168
David Baldus,Based on the model discussed in the methods section I estimate travel times from the West Pit to the Partridge River ranging from ~5 months to ~800 years. The range of estimated travel times varies hugely from a matter of months to hundreds of years. This alone suggests that these estimates are poorly constrained and call for more concrete data; specifically hydraulic conductivity and porosity values for the “fissured layer” of the Duluth Complex.,WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 168
David Baldus,there is a high likelihood of acid drainage based on report model results.,WAT,S,O,2,"SDEIS Themes WR 001, WR 002"

Evan Johnson,"I credit the opponents of Polymet for ensuring that 'no stone goes unturned' in regards to the environmental impact statement, but to continue to bring economic and political sway to force against the Northmet project is simply selfish, and bordering on ridiculous. While Polymet has financed their progress, idealogs associated with non-profit organizations have made and used small fortunes against Polymet by effectively manipulating and appealing to the people’s responsibility to protect their own home. They have mis-represented and slandered Polymet on numerous occasions for the sake of gaining political prestige among their peers and to increase their funding. Without the sound minded entrepreneurs of the world like Polymet, these 'environmentally minded' organizations would be lost for lack of prey to leech off. If these 'environmentally minded' organizations were truly concerned for the betterment of the world, they would see that mining in our own backyard with a very mindful eye to the impact on our environment is far more responsible that allowing others to produce the resources we all expect to use daily with next to no oversite and totally out of our control. If they were truly motivated by a love and concern for the environment and those who live in it (all of us), they would recognize that the best use of resources at this point would be to come alongside Polymet financially, politically, and personally to ensure that they operate at the highest of standards as they have indicated they will do in the Final EIS. I am not a terribly liberally minded person, but imagine the final product that could come forth from a strong and real cooperation between Polymet and those who once opposed it, and perhaps still do, but desire and intend to make it literally the best copper/nickel/precious metal mine in the world.",O,NS,X,1,

Therefore, SOS and WLP respectfully request that the Forest Service extend the 45-day objection period to allow enough time to review the FEIS and Draft ROD.",NEPA,S,N,5,
Ryan Talbott,"While the Forest Service claims that an extension of the objection period is not permitted, see Draft ROD Legal Notice (citing 36 C.F.R. § 218.6(d)), it is important to note that the Forest Service’s regulations cannot run afoul of the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) and the Council on Environmental Quality’s (“CEQ”) regulations. NEPA “is our basic national charter for protection of the environment.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(a). “Accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(b) (emphasis added). NEPA’s public participation regulations require the Forest Service to “[m]ake diligent efforts to involve the public in preparing and implementing their NEPA procedures” and to make environmental documents available “so as to inform those persons and agencies who may be interested or affected.” 40 C.F.R. § 1506.6(a)-(b). In some cases, “proposals should be given more time for the thoughtful preparation of an EIS and development of a decision which fulfills NEPA’s substantive goals.” CEQ, Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ’s National Environmental Policy Act Regulations, Q. 35 (1981). Requiring the public to review over 3,500 pages of documents and file an objection within 45 days is contrary to NEPA’s substantive goals and the Forest Service’s obligation to ensure the public has enough time to fully scrutinize the FEIS and Draft ROD.",ROD,S,O,5,SDEIS Theme NEPA 07
Ryan Talbott,"As the Forest Service surely understands, not all projects are created equal. Some projects are relatively straightforward and do not require the same level of environmental analysis as other, more complicated projects. Limiting the objection period to 45 days for all projects ignores this distinction and undermines the public participation requirements of NEPA. To illustrate this point, the Superior National Forest recently approved the “Mixed Use Motorized Use Project,” which authorizes the mixed use of passenger vehicles and all-terrain vehicles (“ATVs”) on 5.25 miles of Forest Service roads. See, Superior National Forest, Mixed Use Motorized Use Project, available at http://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=40836. This project was subject to a 45-day objection period. See Superior National Forest, Legal Notice for the Mixed Use Project Draft Decision Notice, available at http://a123.g.akamai.net/7/123/11558/abc123/forestservic.download.akamai.com/11558/www/nepa/92918_FSPLT3_2537 882.pdf. Without commenting on the propriety of this project, it is safe to say that it is nowhere near as complex as the proposed NorthMet Mine and Land Exchange. Indeed, the revised environmental assessment (“EA”) for the Mixed Use Motorized Use Project was all of 24 pages. See, Superior National Forest, Mixed Use Revised EA, available at http://a123.g.akamai.net/7/123/11558/abc123/forestservic.download.akamai.com/11558/www/nepa/92918_FSPLT3_2485 245.pdf. In comparison, the FEIS for the proposed NorthMet Mine and Land Exchange is over 1,900 pages (not including appendices and thousands of pages of reference documents that the agencies have yet to make available to the general public). A project of this scope and complexity, which will advance a type of mining never previously permitted in Minnesota, requires more than 45 days to file an objection. Sulfide mining is controversial in Minnesota and concern is growing over the threat that copper-nickel sulfide mining poses to our environment and National Forests. This FEIS is reportedly one of the largest, if not the largest, ever for a project in Minnesota. Nevertheless, the objection period is the same as it was in the Mixed Use Motorized Use Project – 45 days. In other words, the Forest Service expects the public to be able to digest a 1,900-page FEIS and file an objection within the same 45-day period as it would for a 24-page EA. This is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to NEPA and CEQ regulations.",NEPA,S,O,5,SDEIS Theme NEPA 07
Ryan Talbott,"SOS and WLP are concerned about errors and confusion in the FEIS citations and project record as well as numerous reports of problems with webpages and accompanying digital documents, possibly indicating a problem with agency servers. These concerns are highlighted by the fact that the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources just published a Notice of Errata Sheet containing reference-related corrections in the FEIS. See http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/input/environmentalreview/polymet/feis/errata.pdf. The fact that just days after the publication of the FEIS, the agencies had to correct numerous references supports the need to extend the objection period to allow more time to adequately review the record and draft an objection.",O,S,N,12,Comment noted.
Ryan Talbott,"While the Forest Service treats all projects equally for purposes of filing an objection, it does not when it comes to resolving an objection. For example, if “additional time is necessary to provide adequate response to objections,” the reviewing officer “has the discretion to extend the time [for resolving objections] for up to 30 days[.]” 36 C.F.R. § 218.26(b). It is arbitrary and capricious for the Forest Service to have the option to extend its deadline for resolving an objection when no such opportunity exists for filing an objection. Finally, it is important to note the timing of the Forest Service’s Draft ROD. As stated above, the legal notice for the Draft ROD was published on November 17, 2015. The 45-day objection period ends on January 4, 2015.1 In other words, the Forest Service knowingly burdened the public with an objection period that coincides with three major holidays – Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s. SOS and WLP have been waiting for the Forest Service’s Draft ROD for almost a year. Releasing the Draft ROD so that the objection period coincides with three major holidays substantially impairs SOS’s and WLP’s ability to meaningfully review the FEIS and Draft ROD and file a comprehensive objection.",ROD,S,O,5,SDEIS Theme NEPA 07
Ryan Talbott,"Therefore, SOS and WLP respectfully request that the Forest Service, in compliance with NEPA and CEQ’s regulations, extend the period for timely objections to at least 90 days. Such an extension is clearly warranted to ensure that the public has enough time to fully scrutinize the FEIS and Draft ROD.

I find this hard to believe. The EIS itself recognizes that the loss of wetlands habitat in the two affected watersheds will occur. Additionally, in the Threatened and Endangered Species Section, there is one highly-speculative paragraph with very little information, that does acknowledge something that seems to be directly opposite the above claim. ""Some of these protected species (such as Canada lynx or gray wolf) could be directly or indirectly affected by project-related noise, vibration, human activity, and rail and vehicle traffic. More broadly, species populations, individuals, or their habitat(s) could be removed or destroyed as part of clearing, filling, or construction activities. Some plant and animal species could also be indirectly affected by the proposed NorthMet project, for example by changes in water quality and environment, deposition of dust, loss of pollinators, erosion, and invasion of non-native species."" So which is it? No ETSC animal would be cumulatively affected, or ""some of these protected species... could be directly or indirectly affected."" You cannot have it both ways. You say two different things in different sections of the report.

MCEA is also skeptical that a strip mine, which is being proposed instead of an underground mine, is necessary. ?",WAT,NS,X,1,

Langton Todd,"While I understand the need for jobs in Northern Minnesota I do not believe this is the correct course to take to provide employment. First this mine only creates 200 jobs for 20 years. If the waste “pond” fails, as it did in Canada, 100 square miles around this mine will be a wasteland. How many people who rely on tourism will no longer have a viable income when this wastewater destroys the area. Polymet assured Canadian officials that the dam that failed would last 500 years also. You and I both know this is impossible. A pit with a poly liner is not going to last 500 years. Second, several mines in Northern Minnesota have recently closed. Metals including iron, copper, nickel, zinc, gold, silver, etc. are all at historic lows. I recently read a op-ed piece in the Star Tribune that concluded that this mine is not financially feasible. This study was well done and was completed by several financial analyst with very reputable reputations. I believe that Polymet will lose money from the onset and when this happens they will belly up to the taxpayer trough and Minnesota taxpayers will be bailing them out. We just got taken for $66 million by another Northern Minnesota mine (I realize that was a taconite mine but ALL metals are at historic lows) and do we really want to bail out another one? Polymet has an abysmal record of leaving open pit mining areas environmental disasters after they leave. I also believe that Polymet’s only goal with this mine is to set a precedent so that they can take whatever they want in the future. I also believe it is immoral the way they have contributed money to the political campaigns of our elected officials to sway their vote to push this permit through. When you approve this please keep in mind that when this waste pond fails and destroys thousands of acres of pristine forest you are ultimately to blame. If you have any conscience at all this will haunt you for the rest of your life (maybe longer ?). We taxpayers will definitely remember who destroyed our beloved forest.",GEN,NS,X,1,
Dave H,"I sternly oppose the activation of the Polymet mine for the following reasons. 1. The state of Minnesota already owns the dubious distinction of being the largest changed/modified landscape-geography in the United States. Why? Global demand for food precipitated the massive drainage of prairie/swamp land thru the great red river valley starting from the Canadian border and extending to the Iowa border amounting to approximately to ? of the state’s wild natural acreage. Iron mining in the NE/NC modified another large percentage of the state’s northern geography in order to satisfy the world demand for steel. Urban sprawl for housing the Twin Cities 4M population. 2. No history exists, anywhere in the world, proving that sulfide mining does not negatively impact the environment. In Minnesota this means potential damage to our: o natural wild rice plots o streams,rivers, lakes o forests and vegetation o wild life o fish o current & future drinking water supplies 3. Jobs are important, but 75 local jobs out of 350 Polymet jobs does not justify the unmitigated risk affecting two very large and nearly pristine watersheds in NE Minnesota. 4. Swapping nationally protected BWCA acreage for mining is a most ridiculous idea. 5. Risk of losing tourism revenue in the NE counties. 6. Foreign owned/backed mining companies have NO risk to their own soil & environment. Lastly, awareness of our state’s diminishing water supply should be enough of an impetus for us to strictly protect ALL ground water, from any and ALL type, OR RISK, of pollution. We all should know by now the, inevitable, water shortage in the coming years will dwarf the agitating cost of current gasoline prices. Without fuel we don’t move around, without water we die. Even more serious, are you ready to increase the risk of polluting the states only natural water supply ever granted by creation to us in this state? Should we continue to lead the nation with the most changed landscape by adding more modified natural acreage for a few million dollars of copper/nickel ore that mostly benefits a foreign nation? My parting thought. Man is the only animal on this planet that Pooh’s in his own nest! Let’s stop it now! Natural resources are not renewable!!!",GEN,NS,X,1,

I certainly would not put my name to such a project in such a unique and cherished wilderness area. When I started in the business in 1970 there were clients that we just had to walk away from. They wanted to circumvent the new rules, delay the costs, take short cuts or build facilities that would not be effective. We resigned fees, got fired and sometimes just walked away.

Groundwater is a public resource. It must be monitored and protected wherever it is, not just at the edge of the mining property, but on site.",NEPA,S,O,6,SDEIS Theme WR 189

However, that's not why I'm writing you. I oppose the project based on the fact that a foreign company wants to come in to one of the finest parts of my state and sully it for short-term gain. The track record of these mines is abysmal, there are NO guarantees against disaster (despite what the engineers say) and only a few temporary jobs will be created. Meanwhile, the risks of impact to the recreation industry, the residents of the area, and the taxpayers footing the clean-up bill are too great.

It was their first visit to this gem of Minnesota. All of them were totally surprised at the unique experience. And this is after family camping trips to Utah, North Carolina, and Alaska. The son-in-law, after spending 3 hours sitting alone on a rock, said that the solitude was the best experience ever. He complained only about someone's constant attempt to start an engine thus disturbing the total silence. It wasn't an engine. It was a grouse! This January I turn 65.

Caree Gordon,"The aftermath of the Mount Polly Mine tailings pond breakage in B.C. is an example of the worst-case scenario of what could happen with the PolyMet/NorthMet project in the Hoyt Lakes area. The Kawishiwi River & surrounding watershed will be affected by the pollution, even if things go well and there is no disaster. The BWCAW is protected, but not protected from the drainage traveling north and east. The Spruce Rd Twin Metals site is nearly adjacent to the BWCAW, and is less than a mile from Gabro and Bald Eagle Lakes. Thousands of visitors to the Superior National Forest and BWCAW seek solace in the wilderness, as it is one of the last areas in our Nation that is protected from pollution. I want to see ZERO pollution and avoid any possibility of a disaster happening in this area. I have signed numerous petitions to defend our Constitution and the Federal Wilderness Act of 1964. Is it really in Minnesota’s best interests to allow a foreign company with no ties, or connections to our pristine wilderness and neighboring communities to jeopardize and possibly destroy what has been protected and maintained for public use? In the future, when PolyMet/NorthMet has completed stripping the area of copper, nickel, and platinum, what will be left with? There will be no second chances after the damage is done. Recently, I was employed as an information assistant for the US Forest Service at the Superior National Forest Headquarters located in Duluth, MN. I issued BWCAW permits and spoke with people from all over the world who were in the process of planning trips to the BWCAW. These people bring commerce to our beautiful State of MN. They spend money throughout the state as they travel north for their vacations. There are many well-established businesses that stand to loose profits if the wilderness is spoiled. PolyMet/NorthMet will create jobs for people in Northern MN, however, the essence of our beautiful wilderness and clean lakes is at stake – the exact reason why so many people choose to vacation and visit Northern MN. I believe the stakes are too high and definitely not worth the risk. Future generations of family members return year after year to experience the unpolluted lakes, forests and solitude that is exclusively offered in the BWCAW and surrounding areas. For long-term commerce, we need to keep MN clean and free of unwanted pollution for the sake of our unique lands, water, animals and forests.

While I, as an individual citizen, lack the resources needed to perform in-depth review of the FEIS, there are a number of areas that are of significant concern and warrant correction, revision of conclusions, and additional outside independent review. I provided comments on the SDEIS. Although I have concerns about the process used to parse comments into brief statements that would receive comment, I will concentrate on my most significant concern - failure to address uncertainty in long-term modelling data and the co-leads failure to identify this as a scientifically indefensible claim.",MEPA,NS,X,1,
Bob Shannon,"My original comment was parsed into comments 7870 and 7872 which were not adequately addressed by the thematic response. Thematic response (WR189) concludes by saying that “...modeling results for hundreds of years in the future should be viewed with appropriate caution.” The co-leads are using hyperbole to gloss over, accept, and validate scientifically indefensible representations about the long term conditions at the site. While models can provide powerful information within the bounds of uncertainty, any conclusions made based on the output will be bounded but its uncertainty. Modeling conditions far into the future, however, is not scientifically defensible unless there is adequate control of the uncertainty of model input parameters, and this uncertainty is rigorously propagated into the output of the model and accounted for in the subsequent assessment process. Lacking any other empirical evidence that supports long- term conclusions based on these models and their “probabilistic estimates”, a reasonable assessment of these claims must conclude that using these models to any longer-term representations is scientifically indefensible. The question is highly pertinent since the output of these models is being used by PolyMet to support claims made that PolyMet will be able to comply with environmental regulations “in perpetuity”. Since there is no basis for bounding the limits of predictions made by the models beyond the first few years, these claims are not scientifically defensible and they should be excluded. Until the state can project the longer term reliability of representations made by PolyMet – who are making claims about conditions “in perpetuity”, they cannot: 1) assess whether the project will maintain compliance with water and air quality regulations well past the point in time one can reasonably assume that the corporation will continue to exist; or 2) provide realistic estimates of the financial assurance needed to protect the State of Minnesota from long-term responsibility for the site should NorthMet or their successors cease to exist.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR148

Alterations of the Laurentian Divide from nearby taconite mines has changed the flow patterns. Given the forecasts for climate change, with high risk of 100 or more year flooding (aw we saw in 2012), the model needs to include the change in watershed features and more accurately include risk to the Boundary Waters Wilderness for centuries to come. The planned clay-lined trench cannot possibly contain 100% of groundwater seepage (Figure 3.2-28) and cannot be adequately monitored for groundwater flows leading north to the BWCA (p 3-150, Section 3.2.3.3.4).

Dry stack start of tailings is a technique to prevent precipitation and groundwater from interacting with the tailings to product acid and sulfate laden runoff.

On a mass balance basis the 500 million tons of processed ore would release millions of tons of sulfur compounds which in turn would produce millions of tons of sulfuric acid and sulfates over time into the environment. Fish, wild rice, and children would not survive but a fraction of this onslaught.",WAT,NS,X,1,
LeRoger Lind,Hundreds of physicians in Minnesota have asked the state Health Department for a public health study focusing on the effects of this potential area wide pollution but have been summarily rejected by the entire state administration. In a stunning display of logic the state determined that enough information exists on potential public health effects from sulfide mining in Minnesota and that a public health study would not uncover any significant information that hasn’t been considered. That opinion is not shared by thousands of physicians and our membership. An independent study is required and any delays in the FEIS process would have been self-inflicted.,HU,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme HU 01

LeRoger Lind,"As evidence of the difficulty in analyzing and controlling acid mine drainage from similar sulfide ore material, over burden containing sulfide ore from the Dunka Mine near the proposed PolyMet NorthMet mine was studied for 16 years at the MDNR facility in Hibbing, MN. Samples from other sites such as AMAX were also tested. The sulfur in the piles dissolved in about 6 years. Acidity increased as sulfates increased with levels varying from one pile to the next. Their tests also show that sulfates and acid are produced at higher volumes and at faster rates from finely ground sulfide ore. It was difficult to control sulfate discharge in the short term after the fine waste rock was generated. Stored rock reacted less quickly due to less surface area.",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 001
Le Lind,"The main conclusion of the tests described above was that it is very difficult to “manage a mitigation” of a source that varies in both size and composition. Scaling results from the test to the mine and the processing waste dumps was defined as being “too difficult” by MDNR scientists. PolyMet is proposing covering and routing water from storage piles to their pit but have limited understanding of where all of the water would be flowing. These tests show that the discharge of polluted water from waste rock and slime storage would be impossible to effectively manage and treat. The FEIS does not define a project that protects the Lake Superior watershed from acid mine drainage consisting of sulfuric acid, sulfates and toxic minerals produced during sulfur dissolution in the waste storage methods being proposed.",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 060-5
LeRoger Lind,"In an associated waste management issue, the MDNR personnel were concerned that sorting and storing various grades of solid waste would be difficult if not impossible.

Resolution of this problem is not adequately addressed in the FEIS.",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 134

LeRoger Lind,The FEIS and other reviews which predict post mining closure water quality use “known” oxidation rates based on a study financed by PolyMet. A very crude model is being used to justify the prediction of the amount of sulfur that would be removed at the processing plant in 100 years. The amounts of sulfur available for reaction vary from 5% to 33% depending upon the stage of processing and waste storage. The FEIS does not adequately describe a reliable method of determining the amount of sulfur that would be mitigated as a function of time from initial production through 100 plus years.,WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 025
LeRoger Lind,"Financial assurance requirements appear to be front-loaded to understate the long term requirements for mitigation of sulfates, toxic metals and related pollutants.

LeRoger Lind,"The FEIS does not adequately evaluate the potential effect of the inhalation of asbestos-like fibers generated at the mine site and in the processing plant. Mesothelioma and other lung disease have been diagnosed in studies by the MN Department of Public Health in taconite workers and local residents. The source of these fibers was the Dunka Mine pit and nearby Peter Mitchell Mine pit. Recent MPCA fiber monitoring results show toxic amphibole levels near 12000 fibers per cubic meter. The data was taken on 08/10/2008 in Babbitt, MN which is later than the June 2007 date of the reference document 2007l.RS61 and so was not taken into account in the FEIS reference which makes this reference incomplete at best. The argument that these fibers are cleavage fragments and thus are not harmful has been debunked by many qualitied experts including Steve Ring in his comments on the SDEIS. Phil Cook (recently deceased) of the EPA’s Duluth Water Lab issued extensive research showing that certain types of these fibers, including ferroactinolite, can be up to 20 times more toxic than even the Libby, Montana fibers which are a toxicity standard. The material at the PolyMet NorthMet mine pit would contain these same fibrous materials interspersed with the sulfide ore PM2.5 dust. Both workers and residents would be exposed to this potent combination of fibers and particles entering their lungs. This FEIS does not acknowledge this as being a health problem. Sulfur based oxides combined with iron based fibers in the lungs represents a new unexplored threat to the public health in the area. A health based standard for the permissible density of these fibers and particles in the mine, processing plant and surrounding residential areas must be developed before any permitting of the mine is considered. Even the World Heath Organization recommends no more than 400 particles in the PM2.5 range as a maximum exposure level for the humans. The EPA test data from the Duluth lab clearly shows that even smaller fibers cause tumors and that the toxicity of the fibers is best determined by their surface area, not their length. The PolyMet NorthMet Mine Project FEIS does not adequately describe a project that protects public health from this source of air pollution. The cancers and lung diseases from this type of air pollution do not surface for decades after the exposure.

The boundary waters and Northern MN is one of the most beautiful places on earth, and I hope everyone involved in this decision personally visits the area before coming to a conclusion.

Indisputably, jobs will be created and the local economy will receive immediate benefits.

Let's further suppose that after a few short years of operation, the state finds the mining interests EIS data tragically incongruous with the reality of the mining operations that are beginning to compromise with a growing circumference all surrounding lakes and streams like a spreading cancer. But, with legal documents in hand and obligatory inspections and resulting fines paid, the sulfide mining would continue unabated. The locals, already angered that the projected job numbers and rebirth of the Range never materialized, will demand justice and compensation. But, there will be neither. For, no amount of legislation can turn back the clock. Unlike a farming operation in southern Minnesota that is dumping excessive nitrates into the rivers and lakes whereby simply reducing or stopping the practice will immediately start restoring the environment, there would be no such outcome with sulfide mining. Mountains of toxic sulfur laden tailings and lakes of equally poisonous water holding ponds will remain forever a testament to the desperation and short sightedness of a brief and sad time in Minnesota's history.",SO,NS,X,1,

Jack Parker,"On Thu, Dec 10, 2015 at 5:55 PM, MN Department of Natural Resources <dnr.updates@updates.mndnr.gov> wrote that the deadline for comments would be extended. Thankyou, it could extend the hearings yet closer to perpetuity. But it may bring this, my fourth submission, closer to the top of the heap.... This, unlike the majority of the opinions I hear, is to suggest that you thank everybody for their interest but to be of good cheer, as befits the season, because most of the discussions and arguments are not necessary. They are pointless. Go home. This is a part of the typical ploy to divide and conquer. Go on your way, rejoicing! The point which they all overlook or fail to comprehend is that the principals behind the Polymet proposal are the same as those who guided the permitting processes for the Kennecott Eagle project, the Kennecott Flambeau project - and now the Polymet project, and, in doing so, committed serious crimes against the law of the land and the people too. They lied and cheated in the proceedings, thus becoming eligible to spend the rest of their days in prison as felons, in Grand Frauds worth billions of dollars - and endangering property and lives too - for profit. So far they get away with it, and the absence of good mining people allows that to happen. The evidence is absolutely clear, already prepared and presented but ignored by the criminals and their accomplices in court, up to and including Attorneys General. I guess that the preparations began some thirty years ago in Michigan. Dow Chemical and Granholm, now retired but a member of the Board. For example - for reasons unexplained but now obvious - the Federal EPA delegated to Michigan DEQ (with zero mining expertise) all authority over mining in Michigan. The AG's lean on that to bemoan the fact that they do not have the necessary jurisdiction. Read Schuette's inaugural pledge - ""to root out and prosecute corruption at all levels of his government."" He could start far above the roots. Ask him about that. Help him by asking where he was employed before Kennecott moved in ... The technical evidence is even clearer than the politics. The application appears to have been written by schoolboys under pressure. Four mining experts, including the one selected by MDEQ, consider that the technical data were tampered with, then misused to produce a mine plan which was, and still is, likely to bring on a sudden and unexpected mine collapse. Even MSHA (Mine Safety and Health) is now implicated. They, like the other agencies, were forewarned, as you are being forewarned, and they ""investigated"" by asking the operator about the charge - and were told that there is no problem. Industry and administrators are on good terms, but rock structures and inherent stresses suggest to the experts that the collapse will indeed be sudden and unexpected. I will leave you with that thought - that you might question Polly people in depth - to get at the truth. I doubt that you have the resources to even ask the right questions. For example: Can you guarantee that no major catastrophes or damages will ever be attributable to the mining as planned? If not - the hearings are closed. You need a better plan. Now you have something pertinent to talk about. Are we again dealing with crooks?",GEN,NS,X,1,
Roger Klisch,"I have been a Minnesota resident all my life and what I really appreciate are the lakes, woods, and natural areas of our state. I visit BWCA annually. While I do recognize that industry provides jobs, the natural treasure we have here is more important to keep untouched. Human civilization has come a long way with technology and yes, with the help of fossil fuels and mining of minerals. But we have also come far enough to see the consequences of overuse of our environment, consumption and waste, and the unsustainable pace of it. Science tells us we cannot keep living in the same way because this planet will suffer severe consequences. We have one home, and humans have now come to a tipping point where we have to now decide to care for what remains and find a way to live sustainably. This project is not only a threat to the BWCA, the northern forests, and watersheds, but continues the devastation of our planet that we can no longer afford. I am also a practical person. I am an electrical engineer and work with machinery and see the uses and benefits of technology. I recognize we do need a certain amount of resources. I use resources just as everyone else does. I do my best to minimize my impact on the planet and I'm working to be a sustainably neutral citizen. If this project could be carbon neutral, not harm our state, and all that is mined from it to be used for renewable or green technologies, then I could consider this. For instance, if all the copper that was mined was mandated to be used for wind turbines and electric cars, then it would be easier for me to support. But generally these projects are all about money and profit, so it forces the cheapest way to extract, process, dump, and sell to the highest bidder. Even with regulations, companies find short cuts just as we saw with the BP Deepwater Horizon project that permanently damaged the gulf coast. When money is the motive then you have negative consequences. If the project is about service to the Earth and to humanity, and it can be done in a sensitive, sustainable, and non-impactful way it could gain my support. I highly doubt there is any consensus on my idea, nor any way to mandate it. But I wanted to voice this as the only way I would ever agree with this project. Since it is unlikely mining could be done in this conscious and sustainable way, then I am in opposition to it. We best recycle to metals we currently have on our planet and find alternative ways to create sustainable living.",GEN,NS,X,1,

The PolyMet project and any other copper-nickel effort at this time is a threat to water sources in the Lake Superior and Hudson Bay drainages and will prove to be a financial/environmental disaster at some point within the next 200-500 years. There are few, if any, copper-nickel mines that haven't proven to be detrimental to local waters and end up costly to taxpayers in the form of cleanup and impacts to the environment. To imagine a company agreeing to provide adequate wastewater treatment for centuries is ludicrous. There are no financial guarantees that a company can be held responsible for such lengths of time when the company simply will not last as long as is necessary to ensure clean water. Also, exchanging thousands of acres of public land in order to allow access to the ore body in exchange for 20 years of potential jobs is also a ludicrous and losing proposition in terms of the ecosystem and water sources. Reverse osmosis treatment will not work on the scale needed to effectively treat all wastewater and to bank on management of the cleanup effort for 200-500 years long after profits (I don't believe it's profitable at this point anyway with low metals prices) are gone. The ore body may be immense in the eyes of geologists and but the overburden and waste will dwarf the actual product. This project isn't tapping into a clean vein of copper-nickel. It is trapped in sulfide bearing rock and will take mountains of energy to extract, further adding to the chain of clmate change.

Nancy Aronson Norr MP,"I am submitting this comment as to the adequacy of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for PolyMet’s proposed mine on behalf of Jobs for Minnesotans, a coalition representing 55,000 men and women of the trades, 2,300 businesses and hundreds more mayors, local chambers of commerce and citizens. The correct steps have been taken to move the PolyMet NorthMet Mine to permitting. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Forest Service have determined that PolyMet’s mine can comply with strict state and federal environmental standards. This assessment is detailed in the FEIS and concludes more than 10 years of thorough study and review.",MEPA,NS,X,1,
Nancy Aronson Norr MP,We are confident in the environmental review process for the project and the FEIS is a culmination of the dedicated efforts of many agencies. Thousands of public comments and questions submitted during the review periods for the draft and supplemental draft environmental impact statements have been addressed and incorporated in the FEIS.,MEPA,NS,X,1,
Nancy Aronson Norr MP,"The agencies considered the project’s potential effects on air and water quality with respect to human health and identified no adverse health risks. Water modeling shows that PolyMet’s treatment and mitigation plans will meet all water quality standards and prevent acid mine drainage. Furthermore, the FEIS states that any possible groundwater flow would be prevented and therefore will not affect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness or Voyageurs National Park.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Nancy Aronson Norr MP,"Based on my review and the level of detail included in the FEIS, it is clear the document meets all state and national environmental requirements.",PER,NS,X,1,

Steve Timmer,"This is a comment to the Final Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed PolyMet NorthMet copper-nickel sulfide mine. It is offered in opposition to the issuance of a permit to mine. This comment focuses on the very real financial consequences to the state and its citizens of a tailings dam failure at the former LTV processing facility, or the persistent pollution of surface and groundwater either from the processing facility site or the mine pits themselves.",PER,NS,X,1,
Steve Timmer,"[Mining], without question, would fundamentally change the character of this region, taking what is today the crown jewel of the national forest system in the eastern two-thirds of the country, and converting its heart into an almost continuous industrialized zone. And this is, perhaps, the biggest flaw in the just-released FEIS on PolyMet. When the DNR opted not to examine the cumulative impacts of this scale of development on the Superior, they chose to ignore the elephant in the room. They opted not to take the hard, scientific look they promised and produced a political document, instead.1",CUM,S,O,7,FEIS Section 6.2.2.1.1
Steve Timmer,"The widely-reported problems with the water model, the potential effects on human health – just brushed aside by state officials on December 7th – and the failure to explain in any meaningful way how regulators will require financial assurances, all illustrate that the FEIS is not completely vetted, and these underlying problems are either not understood or just ignored.",MEPA,NS,X,1,
Steve Timmer,"The fact that the FEIS was ten years in the making is an indictment of the process, nothing more.",MEPA,NS,X,1,
Steve Timmer,"Financial assurances in Minnesota law do not even address themselves to the losses incurred by the public. Only a solvent mine owner, and current, adequate liability insurance will do that. The governor has stated that he will only permit a mine that stands on a solid financial footing, and after a sobering tour of the Gilt Edge mine in South Dakota, Commissioner Landwehr stated that a “bankruptcy proof” plan would be required for PolyMet.",FIN,NS,X,1,
Steve Timmer,"The permit applicant: PolyMet Mining, Inc. Even when consolidated with its British Columbia parent, PolyMet Mining Corp., PolyMet Mining, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, has very little in liquid assets. It is not now, nor has it ever been, an operating business. The stock of the parent has always been just a stock play, and valuation isn’t based on earnings (there never have been any) or even the liquidation value of the company. Well, a stock play and a vending machine for company executives through stock options. The idea that regulators would consider taking this flyer – because that is what it is – is preposterous. Putting a little money in at eighty-nine cents a share as a gamble on the penny stock market is one thing; gambling the legacy of pristine water in northern Minnesota is quite another. PolyMet officials say on the one hand, Well, we’re good Minnesota folks. We’d look after the environment. But on the other hand, they say, A permit to mine could be assigned; we can assign it to somebody with the wherewithal to operate a mine. In a commercial lending environment, the applicant PolyMet would be laughed out of the room and told, Come back, Junior (mining company), with a real partner. The only reason that PolyMet has even continued to exist for the last several years is because of the periodic allowance it gets from its practical parent, Glencore PLC. Glencore’s fingerprints – footprints, really – are all over the PolyMet balance sheet. PolyMet lives, moves (such as it does), and has its being because of Glencore. PolyMet exists on the continuing edge of bankruptcy. Glencore has a first-lien position in all of the assets of PolyMet. The extensive debt owned by Glencore on PolyMet’s balance sheet means that it would be difficult and expensive to replace Glencore with another investor to assign a mining permit to. Doubly so because Glencore has an off-take agreement with PolyMet for the first several years of production from any opened mine. But the Land and Minerals Division seems to want to pretend that Glencore doesn’t exist. There are a lot of adjectives that could be used to describe this, and none of them are flattering. Simply recognizing that Glencore is a real party in interest, maybe the real party in interest, and requiring it to be on the application and any subsequent permit – and be responsible for the financial and environmental obligations imposed on a permitee would not eliminate the bankruptcy risk that the Commissioner worries about, but it would mitigate it... A. On the issuance of a permit to mine to PolyMet, the current permittees, Cliffs Resources and Minnesota Power, would have their permit to mine closed and be relieved of liability for the currently-leaking tailings dam at the crushing facility. (The fact that it is and has been leaking into the groundwater for some time is a demonstrated failure of regulators to enforce the regulations they are charged with enforcing.3) PolyMet would pick up that the liability for the tailings dam. The cost to fix the tailings dam is about ten times what PolyMet has in current assets. The day that a permit is issued to PolyMet, it starts in a $70 million+ hole. A junior banker approving the novation of this liability from two substantial obligors to a lightweight like PolyMet would be cashiered on the spot. B. In a press conference subsequent to the Gilt Edge visit, in response to a question about how to handle the very long liability tails after the mine is closed, Commissioner Landwehr said that PolyMet’s mining permit would be kept open, so that it would continue to be on the hook for its environmental liability. With due respect to the Commissioner, that’s a little like telling a gravely ill person – or one already dead – that he doesn’t have permission to die. A charming sentiment, perhaps, but unenforceable as a practical matter. Loan agreements always prohibit a borrower from becoming insolvent or going bankrupt, too, but it’s useless, of course. C. Insolvency and bankruptcy are no respecters of permits, or Commissioners, for that matter. And it isn’t a solution to say, “We’ll just get sureties.” Sureties become insolvent too. Moreover, surety bonds are not available for a term that is even a fraction of the time horizon for a serious adverse event at the proposed mine or crushing plant, at least now that AIG is no longer around to offer them. The FEIS pays only glancing attention to the issue of financial assurances. A few pages in three thousand. And the language in these pages is full of words like “appropriate” and “propose.” Dancing around the issue, in other words. There is no assurance – there’s that word again – that the public will ever have an opportunity to review and comment on what the DNR concludes is adequate. Or know, without periodic data practices act requests, when the DNR allows PolyMet backsliding, as it obviously has for other mining companies over the years. Quoting from 3.2.2.4.2 of the FEIS: ... It seems that it is expected that PolyMet would “propose” financial instruments that would change over time. All of the above-identified “instruments” (except cash) require somebody to buy them – and continue to buy them on some periodic basis. (I doubt that many of these “instruments” are available for more than a few years, at most, at a time.) D. As soon as PolyMet hit a rough patch at the mine – and you know it would, given the cyclical nature of the commodities markets – it will be back asking to be relieved from financial assurances obligations, or some regulatory requirement. Or the miners will get it. It might be a rough enough patch that PolyMet couldn’t buy or pay for renewed financial assurance “instruments.” This is entirely probable after the mine closes. There will no longer be revenue from mining operations to pay financial assurance renewals The need to pay for water treatment, tailings dam maintenance, and possible dealing with a catastrophic failure of pollution treatment systems will continue for probably at least a couple of centuries. Will PolyMet still be around buying “instruments” in say, year 92 after the mine closes? I think we all know the answer to that. Even PolyMet recognizes the absurdity of the proposition. 3.2.2.1.10 - Reclamation and Long-term Closure Management in the FEIS includes this statement: Water quality modeling performed in support of this FEIS indicates that water treatment systems would be needed indefinitely at the Mine Site and Plant.6 PolyMet hopes to rely on “non-mechanical” treatment systems after only fifty-five years.7 In other words, turn off the pumps and hope for the best. But non-mechanical treatment proved ineffective at the Dunka Pit, and the 2009 PolyMet DEIS was rejected by the EPA for relying on it... The real party in interest, Glencore PLC, must be brought in on the permit to mine and associated applications and named as an obligor on any permits issued. The applicants must put up adequate cash, for financial assurances, and to fix the leaky tailings dam, as a condition of the issuance of a permit to mine. What is adequate must be determined, not by PolyMet and the DNR only, but after hearing and comment by the public. It cannot be assumed that the permitees will be able to buy financial assurance instruments in the future; it is naïve to so assume. If these things are not done, the Commissioner’s words about a “bankruptcy proof plan” for PolyMet will be hollow words, indeed.",FIN,S,O,8,SDEIS theme FIN 02
Mark Colbeth,"PolyMet is suggesting a couple hundred jobs, for how long? 20 years maybe and at what potential risk to the environment and cost to tax-payers left with the ongoing expense of clean-up and monitoring for 200-500 years?

On the other hand, you have an ever expanding group- The""Downstream Business Coalition"". They have an ever expanding membership that currently exceeds 1000 employed by over 50 small businesses. I believe this number will continue to grow if their water does not become poisoned by the likes of PolyMet. What if PolyMet's presence destroys peoples desire to visit the BWCA? How much negative impact will that have on the local economy? What is the downstream risk of re-polluting the St. Louis river?

Such an exchange could negatively impact or destroy over 8000 acres of wetlands and conflicts with Federal policies protecting wetlands. It would also harm habitat for a number of endangered, threatened and species of concern. The FEIS also fails to have an adequate plan for mitigating damage to these wetlands.",,,,,

Tom Thompson,The mining industry has never mined copper/nickel without polluting water in the area concerned. Polymet has never mined. This combination is an unacceptable combination to be unleashed on North East Minnesota.,GEN,NS,X,1,
Tom Thompson,There is a proposal to use reverse osmosis to treat water decreasing the chance of surface waters containing sulfides from polluting other surface water. This will need to be done for at least 500 years of indefinitely. What assurances are there that Polymet will be able to do that. Of course they won’t. Reverse osmosis does not treat water seeping into local ground water underneath holding ponds. What will be done with this?,WAT,NS,X,1,
Tom Thompson,Such holding ponds are proving in other places not to always work. Mount Polley is one example of the disaster that could occur if dams holding the Polymet ponds together fail. There is not an adequate plan for protecting the surrounding area from a disastrous breach or protecting Minnesota tax payers from having to pay for resulting damage. Nor does the FEIS adequately deal with the existing seepage from the ponds held back by dams already 40 years old to be used by Polymet.,GT,NS,X,1,
Tom Thompson,"Other questions need answering. What impact will Polymet have on children, workers, and surrounding communities that rely on fishing, wild rice and drinking water that will be impacted by copper/nickel mining? What will be done about potential asbestos issues? Or will we just wait and deal with it if it arises. Sulfide rock being mined will increase methyl mercury adding to mercury levels in fish and plants. Children in North East Minnesota already have elevated levels of mercury in their bodies. How will this be handled?",HU,NS,X,1,
Tom Thompson,"I find it objectionable that there is not more in the plan for decreasing the carbon footprint or considering the carbon footprint that Polymet will have. Mining is already one of the biggest users of electricity in Minnesota. Added mining and processing will increase this. Is this the right time for increasing Minnesota’s carbon footprint when the world is battling its disastrous effects? Does Polymet have a plan for being carbon neutral? Polymet needs a plan in its FEIS for the fossil fuels that will be burned to accommodate or eliminate them. This should also include the carbon that won’t be absorbed when wetlands are destroyed, peat bogs are torn up and forests cut down and not replanted.",AIR,NS,X,1,

Richard Nolan,"I write to voice my support for the state and federal review process for PolyMet's NorthMet project and the Final Environmental Impact Statement {FEIS). In my view, the decision whether or not to go forward with PolyMet and new mining on the Range is about process, not politics. PolyMet has always been candid in its willingness to comply with every rule, regulation and financial assurance the process requires to protect our environment and the clean water we all depend on. Moreover, the FEIS represents a plan - and execution of that plan will require vigorous monitoring and enforcement. With those factors in mind, the reasons to support the project are clear.",O,NS,X,1,
Richard Nolan,"First, as everyone knows, we need the jobs. With hundreds of miners laid off due to the illegal dumping of millions of tons of foreign government subsidized steel into our marketplace, PolyMet will bring hundreds of good paying new jobs to the Range. With more bad trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership threatening to exacerbate the crisis, we need the project up and running soon.",SO,NS,X,1,
Richard Nolan,"Second, our nation needs the copper, nickel and other precious minerals within the Duluth Complex to meet our needs in defense, manufacturing, high technology, health care, environmental ""green"" industries and medical research. In the future, essential minerals for groundbreaking new cancer treatments should come from northeastern Minnesota, reducing our reliance on platinum compounds we must now import from South Africa. The hybrid cars, wind turbines, solar panels, phones, computers, scanners and other high tech devices that have transformed the world all require cooper and nickel. Yet despite the rich deposits we have right here in our own backyard, we are still importing 35% of all the copper used in America, and almost 1 00% of the nickel. That makes no sense. Moreover, access to minerals is a potential national security issue. The U.S. Geological Survey reports that the United States is 100% dependent on foreign suppliers for 17 critically important minerals - and more than 50% dependent on foreign sources for at least 24 others.",O,NS,X,1,
Richard Nolan,"The third big reason to support the PolyMet project is our obligation to the earth and environment - or as Pope Francis likes to say, ""our common home."" By continuing to import the minerals we need for our products and technologies from China and other nations that sacrifice clean air, water and timber resources for short-term gain, we perpetuate a system that exploits the planet and harms workers. By doing copper and nickel mining the right way, PolyMet can establish a global standard for environmental stewardship worthy of our workers, our region and our great nation. Therefore, with these considerations in mind, I urge the co-lead agencies - the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Forest Service - to move forward so the NorthMet project can be permitted and operational at the earliest possible date.",O,NS,X,1,

The significant potential for degradation of water quality as result of proposed sulfide-ore mining operations in Northeastern Minnesota, both in the near term and, more importantly, in the long term, has very important ramifications for human health. The adverse health impacts of surface and groundwater acidification are a result of, among other things, the likelihood of increased exposure to heavy metals (such as cadmium) and other known carcinogens. It is my opinion that these risks to human health have been dealt with in only a cursory fashion in the FEIS.",HU,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme HU 01
Rome Jeffrey D. M.D.,"This risk is underscored by the fact that the validity of the water model itself has been challenged in a credible analysis by GLIFWC. If the water model itself is in dispute, certainly the implications for human health remain uncertain and require further study before sulfide-mining can be permitted.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Rome Jeffrey D. M.D.,"Additionally, it is untenable to try to establish a meaningful financial assurance package for risks that occur hundreds of years in the future.

William Cunningham,"I oppose the Polymet mine license. Despite the changes in the draft EIS, I believe that the mine will eventually harm the water quality and environment of northern Minnesota. Perhaps this damage won’t occur during the 20-year active life of the mine, but eventually, long after the mining company has left Minnesota, the safeguards will break down and no one will be willing or able to maintain water monitoring and protection. I believe, further, that despite the claims of the company, a significant leakage of contaminated water out of the St. Louis watershed and into the Kawishawi River will occur. This will lead to disastrous pollution of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. It’s bad enough to contaminate Lake Superior and 20 percent of the world’s clean, freshwater supply, but it’s even worse to pollute the BWCA. I realize that there’s vehement support for this project among many residents of northern Minnesota because of the desperate need for local jobs, but I am convinced that only a small number of temporary jobs will be offered to current residents of the Arrowhead. I regard it as folly to sacrifice long-term environmental protection and the potential for sustainable ecotourism-based jobs for short-term gain. In coming decades, clean freshwater will be in far shorter supply and much more essential to our state than copper or nickel, and I urge you to reject this project.",SO,NS,X,1,
Dr. Jill D. Greer,"I would like to express my grave concerns over the safety and negative environmental impact of this NorthMet Mining Project. Please consider this message in your weighing of public opinion on the matter. I am not a resident of your state, but the effects of environmental toxins and pollutants do not respect state boundaries, particularly through the riverine and estuary connections across the entire Midwest. Nor do our wildlife confine themselves by our human-created state boundaries. Thus, it is imperative to include the views of all Americans (and Canadians, for that matter) when weighing the consequences of such large destructive undertakings. Thank you for your consideration as you attempt to wisely approach this serious decision. Remember that the proper way to measure effects is to ask what are the harmful effects of NOT allowing the project, and would these effects be more than a simple financial loss to a particular corporation? The continued habitability for the future earth we are leaving to our children’s children must be the ultimate yardstick for our decisions today. Too many hasty decisions have already marred that future. Let the tide turn back toward preservation and conservation, for those precious generations to come.",GEN,NS,X,1,

Shelley Robshaw,"After a though read of the documents provided to the public, I believe that the review of the NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange was conducted using mostly data provided by Polymet. PolyMet’s proposed sulfide mine would require 500 years of treating polluted water. Nowhere did I see a plan to even escrow funds to cover treatment of pollution that is likely to occur, if not immediately, at some time in the future. There is absolutely no way the state could get Polymet to guarantee coverage of containment and/or clean-up in the likely event of soil and water contamination. All that a business like Polymet would need to do is declare bankruptcy and the taxpayers would be on the hook. This doesn’t even take into consideration the permanent damage to our precious environmental resources in the Boundary Waters and Lake Superior, plus nearby wetlands, streams and rivers. The unemployment issues of northern Minnesota deserve a better long solution, and one that benefits a local business, not an international one with no ties or concerns for our community. Our State Department of Natural Resources should be advocating to preserve our environment, not pander to the business community’s short term profits.",FIN,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme FIN 01

David Ellis Hollenhorst,make sure the financial assurance after the initial mining is completed is very substantial. Mining companies tend to disappear long before the environmental damage is rectified and cost continue to escalate.,FIN,NS,X,1,
Karl Meller,"As I have said before there is a danger of moving too fast on Poly Met. The state seems to back off a health assessment due to possible liability. Another thing that worries me is that the state seems to take some of Poly Met's data at face value. Doing that is like letting the company investigate itself. When some one negotiates with themselves they never lose. If the state guesses wrong on the copper mine and the water is ruined, the relatively few jobs for a rather short period of time would not be worth the damage. While it is true that good paying jobs are needed on the Iron Range these jobs should not be at the cost of enviormental damage. If the water is damaged that could impact in negative way the tourist industry which has provided jobs for many years. The last thing Minnesota needs is a rush to judgment on Poly Met which could cause long term damage to the state and the region",SO,NS,X,1,

Carly Hawkinson,"Due to its negative consequences on both the environment and on the citizens of Minnesota, sulfide mining (PolyMet project) is indubitably unethical and should not be pursued further. Sulfide mining is unethical because it jeopardizes and damages the overall well-being of the greater biotic community. As Aldo Leopold (highly recognized conservationist and author) states, “A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise”. Sulfide mining clearly does not adhere to stability, integrity, or beauty.",GEN,NS,X,1,
Carly Hawkinson,"As I’ve listened to individuals speak up on both sides of this issue, I noticed a few things. The large majority of those in favor of this PolyMet project are not giving any substantial proof or evidence to discount items raised by those against it. I have not heard any quality, educated honest truth to prove the opposing side wrong. Those in favor of this project are driven by money. It doesn’t matter what kind of mining it would be, they just want more jobs. There are no jobs being taken away from anyone – no one is being laid off their job here. This project would just be creating brand new jobs – and as PolyMet has stated it would create ~300 jobs (as a guess). Those guesstimated ~300 jobs would not necessarily be given to people from the Iron Range or Minnesota. PolyMet is an international business, so it is very possible that people they hire will not be from Minnesota. Another point that many people have already stated is that the project would be for ~20 years (also a guesstimate). Only 20 years. That certainly goes by very fast. Twenty years ago it was 1994 – that wasn’t that long ago. Another hap-hazard statement was made in the late 1800’s. A politician was quoted in saying that there was enough old- growth timber across the U.S. that it would take a century just to make a dent in it. In less than 20 years, the old-growth timber was cut down. That was devastating and we are now repairing it by replanting as we have learned about conservation practices. Sulfide mining is not repairable. It is traumatic and its’ damages/death last forever. PolyMet says it will take 500 years to clean up. I can’t seem to comprehend why “we” are even discussing this project with them, with their incomprehensible and irrational data. Again, PolyMet is making a guesstimate...500 years to clean up. I would think that with that number, PolyMet either... 1)has no idea how long it would take to clean up, but they know this is highly toxic so it certainly will take a long time...2)they really know it would never be able to be cleaned up but instead of saying “Never or Forever”, they just threw out a big number instead...3)they don’t care what number they say because they aren’t going to clean it up and why would they, it’s not even their country to care about. And what company would even last 500 years, let alone follow through with their clean-up in a foreign country in which they only got 20 years of product out of? It’s very rare that you hear of companies that are 100 years old. Researching this PolyMet company shows that they are not trustworthy, unethical, and have no concern for the land, water, and people (and workers) who live, work, and recreate in the area they are after. Those in favor of this sulfide mine are seeing dollar signs or at least hope to. But, it doesn’t matter what kind of mining it is, they just want more work/more money. There is a waxing and waning with many professions and skills, and if the people who are living on the Iron Range are not willing to move to a different location to find it (which is what many people have to do in order to find work), then a new type of profession/skill needs to be created in that area – however, jobs such as; drug dealers, prostitution, cock-fighting, the mafia, and sulfide mining are not ethical and all of them damage the overall well-being of the greater biotic community, environmentally and socially. The only reasoning behind any support for this mine comes from people wanting jobs in one area of the state that sees waxing and waning from any type of mining operation. The destruction that this type of mining would be irreversible and any local people who might get one of the few jobs created by this mine would likely end up with severe health problems and live in an undesirable environment. The new wave of the future rests on renewable and sustainable. Why not bring in jobs to the Iron Range area that would be on the leading edge of those green industries?",SO,NS,X,1,
Carly Hawkinson,"The laundry list of negative factors from sulfide mining is outstanding. Another thing that I’ve noticed listening to both sides of this issue is the wide diversity of people who oppose it. I’m happy to see that it’s not just the typical environmentally- friendly tree-huggers standing up for the health and well-being of the planet and all of us who live upon it. The soil is planted for all of us to eat, the air moves for all of us to breathe, and the water cycles for all of us to drink. So, it’s nice to see that others also “get it”. I noticed farmers, doctors, lawyers, Pollution Control Agency employees, teachers, loggers, recreationists, old people, young people...all oppose sulfide mining and they voiced not just their personal concern but also physical and scientific proof of its disastrous, negative effects. But, regardless of any proof, it just takes common sense to realize what irreparable damages and hazards will occur if it were to be done. Other areas of the country and world have not used common sense, pushed away their cares, and sought after the money. And now, we as a global community are suffering from it. Let’s not follow in those mistaken footsteps.",GEN,NS,X,1,
Carly Hawkinson,"Whether it’s been said by others or not, I’d also like to add that the St. Louis River Watershed is one of the largest watersheds in Minnesota. The St. Louis River is the largest U.S. river flowing into Lake Superior (the largest freshwater lake in the world). Another large watershed that would be affected by this harmful activity flows water into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and into Canada and Hudson Bay. The health of our entire 1⁄4 of the state, as well as our neighboring country and global waters, is in the hands of some politicians and greedy companies. The sulfide mining process would bring about demise to the health of our own bodies and those not yet born. The PolyMet workers and their families, others living in the area of the mine, those people living along the major rivers and streams in the watershed, the plants, wildlife, fish, birds, soil, air, water, etc. – the health and life of all these living organisms would be affected. But remember, life is circular. What is affected in one area eventually affects all others. Groundwater moves, food is transported, migration occurs, travelers travel, the wind is blown.",WAT,NS,X,1,

Can you imagine the loss of all the polluted tributary rivers, streams and lakes across this expansive watershed area? Jay Cooke State Park was set aside for the people of Minnesota and its visitors to protect its unique features of its diverse plant and wildlife species that live along the impressive and world-known geologic features of the St. Louis River.

I am a small voice, but the person that owns this voice has experienced Northern Minnesota with summer vacations, fishing trips, seminars and our yearly trip into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA). When my son turned 13 we invented the “Guy’s Trip”; 10-days into the BWCA. The last week of May each year we went on our adventure with a backpack and canoe. We did this until he graduated from college. During these trips I watched him mature into the man he is today, gaining confidence, self-reliance and a understanding of what we have that is unique to MN. He now looks forward to the day he can bring his son on the annual BWCA “Guys Trip”. I am amazed the very people we put into office would jeopardize this great resource. The proposed Sulfide Mining will benefit PolyMet and its investors, it will provide metals that can be used for production of products and give a temporary influx of employment. It will also give MN a 500-year commitment for containment and clean-up of their mining. It will affect the groundwater, it will affect the lakes, it will affect the rivers and lastly it will affect the Father or Mother that is looking to bring their Son or Daughter on a “Guy’s Trip” that will not only create fond memories, but will develop self-confidence, self-reliance and the very attributes we as Minnesotans are known for throughout the USA. MN is a great State for a reason, while we are heavily taxed, we shoulder this responsibility with a sense of pride knowing our dollars are going to the betterment of our citizens. It is a shame we would jeopardize the efficient use of our resources for a few. Tourism in Northern Minnesota could, perhaps will be changed forever. Ask Canada if we could recover from an “accident” involving the storage of the waste product, will out water stay the same crystal clear, will we not damage out Great North Woods beyond repair.

I am aware too, of the lack of employment and growth on the Iron range, and do have grave concerns about this- however, in my view, without the healthy land and ecosystems seen in the area, all else becomes a moot point. I am not convinced that a large mining operation, nor its investors, have the best interests of the land and its inhabitants as a top priority. Money becomes the bottom line- but the life of and on the land itself is not something that can be readily renewed or brought back once damage is done.

Why would anyone even consider this, is more the question. Greed, yes greed. Do they really want to destroy wild rice beds? Do they want to destroy an area where many people world wide come to canoe and enjoy the beauty of the area? In one bio-chemical process, sulfates become sulfides which attach to wild rice roots, destroying entire wild rice beds in the most polluted areas, or greatly reducing plant yield in other stretches of the St. Louis River. Both fish and wild rice impacts affect the Fond du Lac, Grand Portage, and Bois Forte Bands of the Lake Superior Chippewa nation’s treaty rights, as well as affecting fishermen, resort owners, and local residents. As sulfates, mercury and other pollutants work their way downstream, they impact the health and economy of both the Fond du Lac Tribal nation and the citizens of Cloquet, Duluth, MN and Superior WI. Of further concern are the loss of wetlands, destruction of wildlife corridors, and loss of public lands within Superior National Forest to a Canadian mining company whose major underwriter, Glencore, is taking a huge market hit, with shares falling approximately 60 percent over the course of the year.

We have a cabin in Ely and see no upside to this deal. The land exchange is a horrible deal for the State. The mine plans to use old dam technology to contain waste water and slurry. There have been three large scale mining dam failures in the world within the last 18 months. The potential for pollution far exceeds the small, short-term economic gain the area might enjoy; especially given the record low prices of precious metals at this time. Please see the attached Heraeus precious metal price update. Mining companies have not been a friend to the State of Minnesota with Essar Steel being the most recent example. A small group of investors will make money if PolyMet opens and a small group of residents will be employed for perhaps 5 to 8 years. That will be the extent of the mine's economic impact. Then the investors and mining company will leave and we will have to deal with the consequences of the pollution. What will the people employed by the mine do then? The State may employ them to help clean up the pollution. Minnesota is on the map because of our natural resources. They are the most important thing we have. Our lakes and woods bring people to Minnesota from all over the world. Why would we jeopardize these resources for a possible, small, short-term gain? I realize many people in the Iron Range area support the mine. We see their signs on the way to the cabin but you have to consider the long-term, big picture. A polluted BWCA is worth nothing. No one is going to visit Minnesota to see what was once was a natural wonder. Please consider the future generations. We don't own the natural resources; we lease them from our children and grandchildren. Creating the State and National Parks weren't popular decisions at the time they were made.

Kaitlin Seiberlich,"I do not support the decision to allow PolyMet to construct a copper-nickel sulfide mine in Northern Minnesota for several reasons. However, those reasons are not the reason I am writing. Instead, I have been asked to address the problems in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (hereafter referred to as the FEIS) in relation to the prior draft.",GEN,NS,X,1,
Kaitlin Seiberlich,"Some of the major issues I believe the FEIS does not adequately address are the following: purposeful downplaying of potential water pollution, willful ignorance of the state of existing infrastructure, necessity of water treatment after the plant and mine both close, the lack of demand for both nickel and copper, and the reputations of both Glencore and PolyMet. Individually, each of these are large concerns that bear examination. Together, they create a picture that is devastating to any environmentalist worth their salt.",MEPA,NS,X,1,
Kaitlin Seiberlich,"The FEIS seems to be ignoring the fact that they are constructing an open-pit mine near several large bodies of water, all of which lead to even larger ecosystems. At the very least, the mine itself is located almost on the Partridge River, which then continues onto Lake Superior after merging with the St. Louis River. The plant site is located on the banks of the Embarrass River, which follows the same path. If any pollution were to enter the waters, this pollution would not simply remain in the same place. Instead, clean-up crews would have to pursue the pollution all the way into the Great Lakes, a task that would cost millions of tax-payer dollars.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Kaitlin Seiberlich,"Another issue is that part of the proposed mine would be set right in the Hundred Mile Swamp (p. 4-21), a swampland that offers innumerable ecological services to the surrounding lands. These include but are not limited to: pollution filtration, animal habitat, reduction of greenhouse gases, flood control, and nutrient production. If the swamp were to be polluted by the mine, three of those five listed services would no longer be available. Pollution would continue to spread to other bodies of water.",WET,NS,X,1,
Kaitlin Seiberlich,"Polluted water could also flow north into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (hereafter referred to as BWCAW) through groundwater or through other rivers or drainages. Because the waters there have no existing baseline of sulfide levels or other chemicals, there is currently no way to prove that the mine could be the reason for the theoretical pollution. No matter how perfect a scenario laid out on paper seems, there will always be room for unintended consequences. Pollution of the BWCAW, an unintended consequence, would not just disrupt social development in parts of Northern Minnesota, it would also disrupt economic development.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Kaitlin Seiberlich,"The second issue identified in the FEIS is the use of existing infrastructure. The existing tailings basin that would be repurposed for this project is currently unlined and has a history of seepage. Even if the basin were to be restructured and updated for the current purpose, there is some 10% of the wastewater that is assumed to leak and make its way into surface- and ground-water. This is not taking into effect all the pollutants that would be washed into other sources with rain and snowmelt over the course of the 20 year mine longevity. That 10% of the leaked wastewater, laden with sulfides and other pollutants, would be more than enough to have ill effects on the ecosystems surrounding the plant.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Kaitlin Seiberlich,"Water treatment is another major issue with the PolyMet mine, one that is not adequately discussed in the FEIS. While PolyMet agrees that it will treat water for as long as is necessary, the fact remains that historically, many mining companies have not followed through on that promise. Many times, the mining companies will stay until they have all the resources they need, make an attempt at cleaning up, then pull out of the area after declaring it “satisfactory.” In most cases, their attempts at cleaning up are simply backfilling the mine with waste rock, a far cry from the wilderness area they originally dug into. Even if PolyMet were to restore the area to as pristine a condition as possible, they would still end up treating polluted water for decades, if not centuries after the mine and plant both closed down. While this would allow for continued jobs, it would also present the problem of a continued point source of pollution for as long as the water existed. This would prevent the restoration of the mine to its previous pristine conditions.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Kaitlin Seiberlich,"Jobs are a major reason for the introduction of the PolyMet mine to this area of Northern Minnesota. While this is a very understandable reason for the area, it does not make sense economically. There is considerably less demand for copper and nickel in 2015 compared to when the mine was originally proposed in 2010. Copper is one of the most reusable elements we are capable of producing. As of October 8th, 2015, it was estimated the demand for copper would begin to slow down and decline. It has been forecasted that China will not be demanding more copper this year. Nickel is undergoing the same issue – little demand, high supply, declining prices. At this point, it doesn’t make sense to open a copper-nickel sulfide mine, especially when Glencore, the financial backer of the PolyMet mine, is temporarily closing some of its own copper mines due to inadequate demand.",NEPA,NS,X,1,
Kaitlin Seiberlich,"The PolyMet mine is not a self-contained entity. Instead, it is largely funded by the Swiss company Glencore. Glencore has several staff members with dubious reputations that should make people reconsider the project in general. The company itself was founded by Marc Rich, and the company has gone on to be implicated in environmental disasters, human rights scandals, and labor violations. Many people are wondering why this company has been allowed to move forward with destructive procedures like mining after being founded by a man with less-than-pleasant motivations. Marc Rich was pardoned by President Bill Clinton after bribing officials in countries like Nigeria, and assisting Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. That pardon was a very controversial decision, one that was done without consulting the U.S. Attorney General or the U.S. Attorney who prosecuted him. However, this is not the only questionable person behind Glencore. The other man, who is a little more current to the times is Tony Hayward, the current Chairman of the Board of Directors at Glencore. He was in charge when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig spilled 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The fact that other companies are willing to allow him to Chair their Boards is a statement that environmental consequences are beginning to take the backseat to greed.",PER,NS,X,1,
Kaitlin Seiberlich,"If you add in the fact that PolyMet is a new company that has never actually opened a mine, is proposing to open a mine both near and in sensitive wetlands, and the techniques it is proposing to mine with have have never been tested off paper, it seems to be a recipe for disaster. Historically, sulfide mining has not been a clean process, resulting in massive amounts of environmental pollution, and in many cases, this was when the mines were not located near delicate ecosystems, pristine wilderness, and massive bodies of water. PolyMet insists that it is capable of overcoming that stigma, but I believe we should be doubtful. One of the more recent examples occurred in the US: the Brohm Mine in South Dakota accidentally produced acid mine drainage, one of the side-effects of which was turning a nearby stream more acidic than lemon-juice. The company in charge of the mine ended up going bankrupt. Only 1/8 of the clean-up costs were paid by the company because of the bankruptcy. The rest of the clean-up was paid for by American taxpayers. If the PolyMet mine were to end up polluting the surrounding wetlands and other ecosystems, it would have to be fully responsible for paying for the clean-up, no matter how long or intensive the process. I would also like to point out that just because a company can, does not mean they should. Just because PolyMet has proven they can meet pollution standards on paper, does not mean they will be able to do so in action. Just because PolyMet is capable of creating 620 acres of mining area and removing just over 88 million pounds of copper, nickel, cobalt, and precious metals from those mines, does not mean that it is the best course of action. Instead of focusing on the importance of unspoiled wilderness areas or clean water sources, people are being blinded by greed and desire to become the first to tap untouched natural resources. Human greed is blinding common sense, and I implore you to reconsider allowing this mine to be established.",PER,NS,X,1,
Kaitlin Seiberlich,"In summary, I would argue that the FEIS proposed is in no way complete. There are many questions and problems that are left to answer, and in many ways the mine does not seem feasible or logical. I have only addressed five issues. I am certain there are many, many more. I would encourage people to think critically, and also not to simply look at the economic effects of the mine, but also at the social destruction that would result from the establishment of the mine. Large sections of Northern Minnesota host recreational activities year-round for people that come from all over the United States. If the mine were to be established, that activity would either be forced to move, or cease entirely. That would result in a massive loss of economy and jobs to those areas. That is something that cannot be allowed to happen. If the PolyMet mine is allowed to establish itself, that is the beginning of the end for pristine wilderness. I urge you to think about the fact that though the mine could be established by 2018, those who will be responsible for the clean-up and restoration of the area are your grandchildren.",SO,NS,X,1,

Specifically, work by scientists at Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission show that after mine closure, a million gallons of polluted groundwater a day could flow north, into the Peter Mitchell pit, and then Birch Lake. This raises the prospect that the NorthMet project could contaminate both the St. Louis River and the Boundary Waters watersheds, simultaneously.

Surface water quality impacts will be different and will require different management depending on how the mine’s waste water moves through the landscape and where it expresses to surface water. Of particular concern is the movement of water through the Peter Mitchell taconite pit about a mile north of the proposed mine. Rock in that pit is known to be acid-forming and yet the EIS does not take that into account in any way, even though it acknowledges that water is likely to move through that pit and discharge eventually into the Rainy River watershed.

The modeling performed by consultant ERM makes a blatant error in the elevation of the land surface. That error forms the basis for their conclusion that water will flow south and remain in the Lake Superior basin. If the water flows north, it will violate the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact, a binding agreement in which Minnesota committed to not divert water out of the Great Lakes Basin. Without further investigating the question of where waste water will end up, any attempt to respond to this issue is nothing more than a guess. This use of adaptive management to address this concern is inadequate and inappropriate.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 081. MDNR et al. 2015c
Cheryl Kallio,"In other parts of the country, EPA has expressly rejected the idea that adaptive management can replace due diligence during the planning phase. Instead, adaptive management is appropriate as a tool to monitor and adjust management actions during the life of the mine based upon information that becomes available over time. There is simply no reason that groundwater flow and quality cannot be better understood prior to mining. Importantly, it is required. We encourage you to reject the adaptive management approach as a means to avoid answering the essential question of where the mine water will end up and what its characteristics will be. The country’s largest fresh water lake is at stake.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Cheryl Kallio,"More than 66 percent of the Great Lakes’ original wetlands have been filled in or destroyed. Wetlands provide essential services for people such as reducing flooding, preventing erosion and improving water quality. They also provide vital habitat to wildlife, waterfowl and fish, and are the backbone of the region’s outdoor economy. The PolyMet project would destroy over 900 acres of wetlands. Additionally, the mine will adversely “impact” between 6,600 and 7,500 additional acres of wetlands. The sheer physical impact of this immense amount of habitat destruction and its impacts to wildlife remain undisclosed, as do the effects of the loss of the ecological function of these wetlands. We believe this would be the single largest permitted destruction of wetlands in the Great Lakes basin since the passage of the Clean Water Act, over 45 years ago and should not be allowed.",WET,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WET 07

By this logic, mining just continues generation after generation, until at some point the mineral resources just run out. Then, a post-mining economy will be the only choice. In northeastern Minnesota, there is currently a large eco-tourism and vacation economy that would be seriously negatively impacted by mining all resources including throughout the BWCA. Since mining is of dubious profitability for the mining companies and even less like to produce any lasting wealth for Minnesota, Minnesota would be better off in the long term to ban all sulfide mining and make the shift to a post-mining economy now. In this way, the amenity of a pristine wilderness environment can continue to support an eco-tourism and vacation economy in perpetuity - and simultaneously act as a draw for families and workers interested in working in the post-mining economy.

Such mismatches present an obstacle to cumulative effects analysis. .... Cumulative effects analysis should be the tool for federal agencies to evaluate the implications of even project-level environmental assessments (EAs) on regional resources."" Those preparing the FEIS are suffering from the problem of such a mismatch and missing that the Cumulative Effects of the Polymet proposal impact the regional resource which is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA). In addition, on page 19, CEQ states: "" ... the analyst should use the best available information to develop scenarios that predict which future actions might reasonably be expected as a result of the proposaL Such scenarios are generally based on experience obtained from similar projects located elsewhere in the region.""

Andrew Comfort,"The FEIS states on page 6-21: Teck is considering operations to mine the Mesaba deposit near Babbitt, St. Louis County, Minnesota, approximately 3 miles east of the NorthMet Mine Site, for nonferrous metals (copper-nickel). The current phase is exploration and drilling. The project may require a joint State-Federal EIS. Preliminary data collection to support environmental review and permitting is underway. The Teck lease holding, however, is not 3 miles away. It immediately neighbors the Polymet site. The two sites touch. They are zero miles apart. I have layered maps from MNGS and Polymet and others and imported into CAD software for analysis and show a detail of this in Figure J. In Figure J, it is clear that Polymet (bounded iin red) and Teck (bounded in yellow) touch. Figure K shows the proposed mine pit locations as provided by Polymet. Measuring the distance between these in CAD shows they are less than% miles apart. Exhibit B, Figure 12 also shows that the current Laurentian Divide passes through this % mile gap. So, my key SDEIS comments were ignored by MDNR (ie regarding the Laurentian Divide and the likelihood that Polymet and Teck would eventually form a single Teck- Polyment Mine Pit Lake) when preparing the FEIS. But worse than just being ignored, this total inaccuracy about Teck being 3 miles away is included in the FEIS. I am just a citizen and do not have time to go through the several thousand page FEIS, particularly when we are only given 30 days for review, rather than the customary 90 days. So I have just taken a ""deep dive"" in this particular area and in this ""deep dive"" I find the wild inaccuracy ofTeck being ""3 miles east"" of Polymet. This undermines my confidence that any of the FEIS has been conducted with rigor- that this level of sloppiness suffuses the entire effort. So the FEIS is inadequate, additionally because it does not properly state the geographic relationship between Teck and Polymet. When the preparers focus their attention on the actual proximity of these two lease holdings, I request that they also focus their attention on the continuous band of ore that connects the two proposed pits and the many historic trends in Minnesota that strongly suggest that a band of ore will be fully mined and that Teck and Polymet will then become one mine pit and that at closure, this mine pit will drain into the Dunka River and onward to the BWCA. Minnesota Rules 4410.0200 requires that they MUST do this. CEQ guidance suggests that they should do it as well.

A typical quote from that response says that “the slurry cutoff wall and collection trench approach has been used for many decades, beginning initially as a means to facilitate construction of deep foundations in locations of shallow groundwater and difficult soil conditions, and subsequently expanding to other uses such as the containment of contaminated groundwater emanating from unlined waste disposal facilities (e.g., landfills, stockpiles, etc.).” However: • There is no specific mention of the use of this method in any sites that are closely comparable to PolyMet’s proposed tailings basin site. • While Thematic Response PD07 says that the presence of boulders and cobbles is handled, along with some other site-specific conditions, it does not say how those conditions are handled.

Joel Roberts,"2. The response to Comment ID 19577 (submitted by the Fond du Lac band) probably is the most relevant to the overall quality of the comment responses. Here is a quote from that response. The Co-lead Agencies acknowledge that there are existing water containment systems at other mine sites that do not operate with a high degree of capture, but these are different designs and cannot be compared to the system proposed for the NorthMet Project Proposed Action. The proposed containment system uses pumping on the tailings side and discharge on the opposite side to reverse hydraulic gradients across the slurry wall and in underlying bedrock. Relatively few containment systems have been built with this degree of pumping and discharge to ensure effective containment. The conceptual hydraulics of this type of system provides evidence that it would achieve complete or nearly complete capture. Here are some observations • The source of the discharge on the opposite (presumably, downstream) side of the seepage barrier is not specified. Is it coming from the Waste Water Treatment Facility, or from somewhere else? What is the magnitude of the discharge? It probably would be some hundreds of gallons per minute. • The fact that the proposed system is different from the water containment systems at other mine sites is presented as a basis for claiming (or at least hoping) that the performance will be better. Many of those other systems operate at less than 60% capture efficiency, but it is claimed that the proposed system will operate at better than 90% capture efficiency. While there may be reason to expect some improvement, no tangible reason is presented that would give an impartial observer confidence that such a dramatic improvement actually will happen. Unfortunately, almost everything is based on computer simulations, and very little is cited in the way of actual experience or testing. • The collection pipe is roughly four miles long (two miles along the north side and two miles along the west side), and it is perforated so that water can be collected. Very little is presented about specifications for the pumping system, such as: o How many pumps are used, what is the spacing between them, and what is the power rating? o What (negative) pressure has to be generated in order to achieve the desired hydraulic gradients?",WAT,S,O,8,"The expected capture efficiency of the FTB Containment System was determined by reviewing industry use of similar systems, groundwater modeling, and hydrogeologic assessment.

See my previous SDEIS comments on the evidence that the TB has internal shifting such that sampling wells have been bent so badly they were put out of commission. No cement pillars around the outside will prevent this shifting on the inside. This shifting could gradually but seriously affect the integrity of the liner of the HRF.

Bruce Johnson,"My comment 15326 regarding the toxicity and degradation products and toxicity as it relates to environmental impacts was responded to with Theme Code HAZ 04. The Theme code answered my comment stating that the MSDS answers my question. Before I wrote the first comment I reviewed all MSDS’s. They did not answer my comment thus I commented on the lack of analysis in the SDEIS. MSDS’s are written for the health and safety of workers that handle a product. The MSDS are not required to provide any environmental health or chemical degradation or mixture information. For example, Flotec Pax (Potassium Amyl Xanthate, Potassium Isoamyl Xanthate) is proposed by PolyMet to be used extensively in the beneficiation process. The MDDS has a small section that describes some ecological information: it is acutely toxic to rainbow trout at >10 -100 mg/l. an acutely toxic to water flea >1-10 mg/l. It states that it is “toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long term effects in the aquatic environment”, it further states: “this matter is not biodegradable”. The MSDS contains no mixture toxicity information when it is mixed other reagents in the beneficiation process. Clearly the use of this chemical with others in large amounts for 20 years and then discharging them into the tailing basin adds toxics to the basin. Assuming the FEIS prediction of 90% collection of seepages from the basin actually works as hoped. It would return the seepage into the basin. Once returned to the basin an unknown amount and concentration will accumulate and at an unidentified point the remainder will be pumped the wastewater treatment plant. This plant does not have removal rates for any of the flotation chemicals. One would expect an undetermined amount to be sent to both the hydrometallurgical facility as sludge where it will concentrate. The remainder will be returned to the tailing basin where it will further concentrate to a yet undetermined concentration. Another unspecified amount (at least 10%) and concentration will be lost to seepage and enter receiving waters through the shallow groundwater and ultimately the surface water.

Bruce Johnson,"The FEIS oversimplifies the impacts of ANFO. In Canada ANFO release has been studied and it has been necessary to regulate a Canadian report states ANFO is regulated in surface water using the following statement: Because of the potential adverse environmental effects of ANFO, its use in Canada is regulated by Section 36(3) of the Fisheries Act (1985), which prohibits the deposit of deleterious substances into waters frequented by fish, unless otherwise permitted by regulation. There is no regulation pursuant to the Fisheries Act that permits the deposit of by-products resulting from the use of ammonium nitrate-fuel oil mixtures. Also, the use of ANFO near bodies of water is not recommended by the Institute of Makers of Explosives, which stipulates that No use of ammonium nitrate-fuel oil mixtures occurs in or near water due to the production of toxic by- products (ammonia). The report concludes: “The literature review indicates that the most common environmental issues associated with the use of ANFO are related to dissolution of AN and to oil wicking. Nitrates and ammonium are readily soluble in water, and thus can very easily reach groundwater. Nitrates exceeding the CCME guidelines (2003) of 13 mg NO3-/L for freshwater (or 16 mg NO3-/L for the protection of marine life) are at risk of causing methaemoglobin, especially in babies. In addition, the presence of nitrate in marine water will cause algal blobs and eutrophication. The toxicity of the ammonium ion is low, but the ammonium in water is in equilibrium with ammonia, which is characterized by a much higher toxicity. Aquatic life is affected when concentrations of ammonia exceed 0.019 mg/L (CCME, 2000). In addition, ammonia in concentrations above 25 mg/m3 for a 15-minute period or the IDHL of 210 mg/m3 (NIOSH, 2007) poses a health hazard to humans. However, this situation is not likely to happen to CF members, given the fact that ANFO is usually handled outside.” (Defence R& D Canada, Jan 2010). - The FEIS failed to evaluate impacts from oil wicking of ANFO (Defence R& D Canada, Jan 2010).",WAT,S,N,3,Section 8.4.2 of PolyMet 2015q

ANFO blasts will occur at least weekly. Liter states the leaching of blasts have been documented to leach for 5 years. Thus, assuming the ballast size and frequency remain constant over 20 years, leaching concentrations will increase for the first five years and remain stable for the next 20 years and decrease for the remaining five assuming closure after 20 years.

The FEIS proposes the tailing water will be recycled and at an undetermined concentration in the basin and will be sent to the mine site treatment plant. It will be treated to an undetermined extent by the treatment system since it is not being discharged. The undetermined concentration of nitrates in the sludge will be sent to the hydrometallurgical process and concentrate to undetermined higher levels.

Bruce Johnson,"Comments Regarding 90% recycling of Tailing Basin Water. The proposal in the FEIS is to concentrate the water accumulated in the pits, and waste rock and other ancillary areas discharge will be “treated” at the WWTF and discharged to the Tailing basin. The WWTF treatment sludges will be discharged to the hydrometallurgical facility. “At least” 90% of seepage from the tailing basin will be captured and treated for reuse in the beneficiation process. This “recycling” process ignores a number of critical issues:",WAT,NS,X,1,
Bruce Johnson,"Since no direct discharge is planned to surface water surface NPDES water standards will not apply to internal “treatment” concentrations, as long as a discharge does not occur to surface water. This means the treatment process is internal and will not have to meet any surface water regulatory standards, or predictions in the FEIS. Thus if the treatment facility could meet surface water standards, which has not been demonstrated using seepage wastewater from field sites such from the Dunka Mine, will not be required. Thus the plant will not be required to meet a set of standards under a NPDES permit. As a result the plant will be operated in such a manner as to not allow the production process to be fouled. This level of “treatment” has not been describe or evaluated.",WAT,NS,X,1,

Bruce Johnson,"1. The FEIS assumption that saline water is found in only in ground water pools in fracture areas (FEIS p 5-132) ignores current science on the subject. Two published geological research reports have conclusively identified the source of brackish water (salt) within the Duluth Complex. The salt is contained within dry micro-fractures within troctolite rock (Dalberg, Sanini-Eidukat, 1991; Pasteris, Harris, Sassani, 1995). When this rock is exposed to water, in fracture zones or by crushing, the salt dissolved into the water.

Bruce Johnson,"3. The FEIS (p. 5-131) unproven allegation suggests that PolyMet pit depth is shallow compared to the Amax and is not in the same rock units. This is inaccurate since the rock units dip downward to the southeast from PolyMet. Thus Unit 1 at Amax is at the bottom of the mine and Unit 1, and the other units at PolyMet are on the surface (Patelke, 2010). Additionally Dahlberg stated the inclusions were found “Within drill cores at distances ranging from 11.3 to 917.5 m (37 to 3009 ft) from the foot wall (footwall is defined as the mass of rock beneath a fault, ore body, or mine-working) of the Duluth Complex,...”. Thus, it is highly probable chloride inclusions will be encountered by PolyMet.",WAT,S,N,3,"FEIS pg 5-132. SDEIS Themes WR 010, WR 078"

The mine has been abandoned and shaft was sealed and filled with water for many years. The surface area is exposed to anoxic leaching. The sidewall surface area exposed is small compared to both the PolyMet pit sidewalls and the disposed waste rock surface area. On October 10-11, 1985 DNR minerals sampled the water in the shaft to a depth of 300 ft. Results from the sampling on October 3rd demonstrate nickel, cobalt, chloride, specific conductance all exceeding 2B surface water numerical standards averaging Yet pH has a mean average of 7.5. (DNR AMAX Shaft Test Data). The shaft contains low concentrations of sulfide bearing rock and has a small surface area exposed to leaching compared to PolyMet’s high sulfur waste rock and high sulfur Virginia Formation and waste rock sidewall in the proposed east pit. The chronic standards for waters in the area is nickel is 0.088 mg/l (hardness 50mg/l), cobalt 0.005 mg/l (not hardness related), chloride 230mg/l.

Both density and diversity of invertebrates colonizing artificial substrates are low when compared to oligotrophic natural lakes. (Pierce Rodney B., Tomcko Cynthia M., November 1989).

David Paulson,"The Revised Final EIS is inadequate because there are two major and fundamental flaws with the described current PolyMet NorthMet Project plan for preventing and treating wastewater (in order to prevent significant water pollution). Importantly, both flaws are easily remedied. Although ore and tailings wastewater discharge is expected from the start of mining operations, treatment of the pollution and potential for future pollution characteristic of these wastewaters is delayed for decades, while it is (hopefully all) collected and stored in various locations. It is exactly such wastewater storage decisions (e.g. delayed treatment) that have led to both increased levels of pollution, and to the catastrophic site failures that have plagued hard rock mine sites in the USA and worldwide, and continue to do so where treatment is postponed. The membrane technology (reverse osmosis etc.) which has been often cited as the insurance of water pollution prevention that the pubic and regulators should accept, is not planned for use until decades into the future. This is a major planning error. Further, membrane technology is not even mentioned as a possible treatment to prevent acid mine drainage, which is admitted as a possibility. It is a major omission to not address this as an alternative treatment - by continuous treatment of the relatively low volume of ore and tailing seepage expected from the start of operations. This is a relatively low cost and feasible alternative Nor is it addressed for future impounded wastewater treatment of heavy metal bearing ore and tailings, should acid mine drainage accumulate as it has at a majority of sulfide bearing hard rock mines. These are both serious planning oversights, which ignore an efficient and proactive solution while postponing treatment. This is a major planning error because of simple risk-cost principles.",ALT,S,O,4,SDEIS Theme ALT 13
David Paulson,"The justification for this delay in treatment is based on several optimistic assumptions, including the most-suspect assumption that acid mining drainage will not occur at any of the several long-term tailings storage dumps planned due to buffering capacity of the rock. This high risk decision is based on only the mining companies own short-term jar testing and “computer modeling”. These optimistic projections all involve circumstances and projected outcomes that do not align with the overwhelming historical record of pollution control failure in similar mines.",WAT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WR 001, WR 023"
David Paulson,"To summarize our point and the problems of the RFEIS: It would involve only an incremental cost to use the same technology that the EIS relies on to assure compliance by actions on the future, but in a proactive manner which would greatly reduce the chance for environmental degradation. That is, use reverse osmosis and related membrane technology at the start of mining operations to remove pollutants and purify waters, and plan for its use for treatment of any AMD that does accumulate, which is certainly a statistical possibility. Although addressed nowhere in the RFEIS in discussion or alternative actions cited, both of these uses are proven in the industry in mine sites that are similar to NorthMet.",ALT,S,O,4,"SDEIS Themes ALT 13, WR 023"
David Paulson,"Importantly, if membrane technology were employed proactively on all “seepage” from the ore and tailings, and other wastewater that is acknowledged and anticipated, the potential damage from metals and other pollutants, and future acid mine drainage –should it occur – would not only be better mitigated. But such actions would also prove from the start of mining operations that the pollution control technology actually works as planned, allowing time to test, revise and refine the technologies and their specific use at the site. A positive pollution control outcome would be more likely by a very high degree. This approach would go much further to assure the realization of several promises made in the RFIES, AND would proactively prove the plans for water pollution mitigation are sound, AND would reduce future clean-up costs which are the subject of negotiations for bonding costs.",ALT,S,O,4,SDEIS Theme ALT 13
David Paulson,"The current plan for control of water pollution is complicated by multi-step ore and tailings placement and movement, repeated and changing over time, and based on risky extrapolations. The resulting complicated plans and optimistic assumptions for impounding and postponing treatment rely on modelling, instead of the real world experience which is available. This increases inherent risk. Acid mine drainage (AMD) from hard rock, sulfide-bearing rock is the norm at such mine sites, based on a hundred if not several hundreds of examples worldwide. This AMD formation has occurred at other so-called lower sulfide content rock mines including recently at the Brohm / Gilt mine in South Dakota. This mine’s highly significant AMD pollution demonstrates the inherent risk in planning on low sulfide rock and delayed actions as an acceptable approach.",WAT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WR 001, WR 023"
David Paulson,"Also not addressed in the RFEIS is the fact that successful examples of using membrane technology to prevent pollution by, instead of impounding and storing wastewater, treating and returning water to mining operations or the aquifer or surface water discharge has been shown to be successful method. In a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, such proactive wastewater treatment plans are far superior to postponing the gain of knowledge of the necessary treatment, and delaying action as an economic decision.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 023
David Paulson,"Many or most of the scores of known failures of treatment or impoundment at sites with AMD, and related pollution, would have been prevented by such proactive treatment. Many were catastrophes that would have been prevented by deploying membrane technology at the start of mining activities, not delaying treatment until after closure. That strategy has failed in sores of documented cases.",ALT,S,O,4,"SDEIS Themes ALT 13, WR 023"
David Paulson,"Membrane technology (specifically RO) has repeatedly cited by both the PolyMet Project and the regulators who have addressed it. However, they have missed describing two beneficial uses at this site. Various other uses are described in the EPA Reference Guide to Treatment Technologies for Mining-Influenced Water, #EPA 542-R-14-00. Given the cost of the project, a relatively small-scale investment in using membrane technology at the start can make the mine a zero liquid discharge site. These technologies’ full potential may not be understood by the engineers and technologists in these organizations. The evidence for this statement is that this option has been ignored in all EIS drafts, plus ignored in the “Fact Sheets”. To not even list this approach as an alternative is an omission that may indicate an ignorance of the modern mine sites currently operating with proactive treatment, instead of impoundment, storage and treatment plans postponed for decades and predicated on optimistic water chemistry projections and storage basin stability outcomes.",ALT,S,O,4,"SDEIS Themes ALT 13, ALT 15"

Tyler Kaspar,"Concern exists over the methods used to estimate baseflow in the upper Partridge River (sections 4.2.2.2.2 and 5.2.2.2.2). XP-SWMM model estimates of Partridge River baseflow presented in the FEIS have been found to be three times lower than observed values. The XP-SWMM projections, which are based on USGS hydrometric station data from 17 miles away collected from 1978 to 1987, do not align with the rating curve from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) winter monitoring data, or the results of the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife (GLIFWC) projections taken from two years of recent data from the Dunka Road gage in the XP-SWMM model. Co-Lead Agencies have worked with Cooperating Agencies on this issue, but it is not addressed in the FEIS regarding how it may affect modeling results. The models may be under-predicting the amount of water and contaminant load that will need to be treated and contained at the Mine Site. Questions have also arisen on data use, including if new data is being utilized and how existing data was selected (or not selected) for use. Although the FEIS includes a groundwater baseflow sensitivity analysis that considers the effect of variable groundwater baseflow inputs on water quality, additional analyses should be performed and included in the FEIS that investigate how the XP-SWMM model predictions may change with using more recent baseflow measurements for the upper Partridge River and how that may affect the MODFLOW and GoldSim model predictions.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 091.

In particular, the potential for groundwater to flow north from the proposed Mine Site to the existing Northshore Mine, ultimately to the Rainy River Watershed and Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), has been largely ignored. Although some details for the potential of a northward flow path is acknowledged in sections 5.2.2.3.5, 5.2.2.3 .6, and 6.2.2.3.1, it is portrayed as being unlikely and little detail is given on the potential impacts that would occur and how those impacts could be avoided/mitigated. Given that a northward flow path currently cannot be ruled out, greater detail on the potential impacts need to be included in the FEIS.

What is clear in the FEIS is that the existence of a northward flow path and the feasibility of using any mitigation option would not be determined until the project is up and running. This is a major concern and inadequacy of the FEIS. Not knowing if there will be groundwater flow to the north (impacting the Rainy River Watershed, an entirely different watershed than what is described in the FEIS) and the feasibility of the proposed mitigation options until operations have commenced is unacceptable. If a northward flow path is determined while in operation, it is likely that impacts will have already occurred and mitigation (not avoidance) will be the only option. Also, there should be an explanation of what will happen if, while in operation, a northward flow path occurs and it is determined that none of the proposed mitigation options are feasible.

Augmenting stream flow to tributaries with treated water treated at the WWTP will impact surface water hydrology. We believe that the interaction of the project's impacts with natural variability in precipitation would be more adverse than reported in the FEIS. This is because effects of climatic variability are additive to the project-related change, which would be especially true for drier periods.

The Co-lead Agencies agree that multiple actors can affect whether a wetland would experience indirect effects due to a project. This FEIS quantitatively assessed all potential indirect wetland effects from the NorthMet Project Proposed Action that may result from one of the following six factors: 1) wetland fragmentation; 2) changes in wetland hydrology from changes in watershed area; 3) changes in wetland hydrology from groundwater drawdown resulting from open pit mine dewatering; 4) changes in wetland hydrology from groundwater drawdown resulting from operation of the Plant Site, including groundwater seepage containment; 5) changes in streamflow near the Mine Site and Plant Site, as well as associated effects on wetlands abutting the streams; and 6) change in ·wetland water quality related to atmospheric deposition of dust and rail car spillage associated with Mine Site and Plant Site operations. The methodology and evaluation criteria used for assessing potential indirect wetland effects are described in detail below. The monitoring and mitigation for potential indirect effects would be determined during permitting. Section 5.2.3.3 of this FEIS includes a detailed discussion on the monitoring and mitigation plan for the indirect wetland effects.

This does not meet the NEP A requirements for an EIS. The purpose of an EIS is to inform potential impacts that may result from the project and not just where monitoring should take place. If the project detects impacts to wetlands after the start of operations instead of understanding where impacts could/would occur before operations, it will be too late to evaluate ways to avoid those impacts and mitigation (assuming proper mitigation is feasible) will be the only option.

Resource assessment areas of concern include wetlands, groundwater, and surface waters. We do not believe the impact zones and distances are well described. Accounting for these factors, GLIFWC conducted an independent assessment using the same methods as the Colead Agencies, along with additional analog data from other mining-impacted sites. The assessment found an estimated total of 5,719.75 acres of wetlands would be potentially susceptible to severe indirect impacts from mine pit drawdown. We also disagree with the conclusion that the Partridge River would act as a ""natural barrier"" to the cone of depression, which suggests that the riparian zone of the Partridge River will not be affected by groundwater drawdown (page 5-279). The upper Partridge River is located in Zone 2; GLIFWC's independent analysis estimated drawdowns of 3 to 5 feet under the river, which would severely reduce baseflow in the channel, indirectly impact riparian wetlands downstream, and affect other surface water features.

These projects included the Cook County Land Exchange, Crane Lake Land Exchange, Fall Lake Land Acquisition, and Wolf Island Phase 2 Land Acquisition. The SDEIS included a brief description for each of these land exchange and land acquisition actions.

Tyler Kaspar,"We realize that details have not been finalized, but this project (along with all federal land exchanges) can affect treaty rights. Treaty rights are exercised on public lands in practice, but exchanges even when remaining in public ownership can raise some concerns. The Forest Service has a trust responsibility to the bands and is required to consult on a government to government basis. This relationship is not as well defined with state or local governments. Changes to or loss of federal ownership (and federal oversight, trust responsibility, consultation, etc.) impact the exercise of treaty rights. The loss of federal lands also could result in changes to management, increased development, or even loss of public lands through sale. In addition to any direct resource impacts, these concepts should be kept in mind during land exchange processes.",LAN,NS,X,1,
Tyler Kaspar,"The FEIS states that financial assurance requirements for the project are not included in the document, but will instead be determined during the permitting phase.

The environmental effects, expensive cleanups, and bankruptcies at other precious metal mines raise a significant red flag.

I also assume that the profits would go to the mining company. I'm curious what the expected Return on Investment (ROI) will be for PolyMet. Cost: I believe 250,000 visitors come to the BWCAW each year. When they come, they add to local economies by purchasing gas, food, supplies all of which generate revenue and jobs in the region. Once the water is polluted, I expect those visitors to go elsewhere. Water is 10 lbs/gallor so it would not be logical to think campers can carry in their own drinking water. I suspect the fishing appeal would also diminish. Also, the pollution will last for generations-probably much longer than PolyMed will stay in business. After PolyMed is no longer a corporation, MN will be on the hook for any ongoing cleanup. This is a big liability for MN.

Paula Maccabee,"The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the PolyMet NorthMet open-pit copper-nickel mine project is a huge, cumbersome and repetitious document. It would be tempting to put it on a scale and deem it adequate by sheer weight alone. However the PolyMet NorthMet FEIS fails to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. §§4321 et seq., and its implementing federal regulations or with the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act (MEPA), Minn. Stat. §116D.01 et seq., the state environmental review law patterned after NEPA, and its implementing state rules.",NEPA,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"Under both NEPA and MEPA, the purpose of an environmental impact statement (EIS) is to lead government decision makers to take a “hard look” at the environmental impacts of their decisions before those decisions are made. See e.g. Mid States Coalition for Progress v. Surface Transportation Board, 345 F.3d 520 (8th Cir. 2003); Sierra Club Northstar Chapter v. Kimbell, 2008 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 107239, 68 ERC (BNA) 1664 (D. Minn., Feb. 19, 2009); Citizens Advocating Responsible Development (CARD) v. Kandiyohi County Bd. of Comm’rs, 713 N.W.2d 817, 834 (Minn. 2006). At the most basic level, an EIS must analyze the significant environmental impacts of a proposed action and provide a full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts. Minn. Stat. 116D.04, Subd. 2a; 40 C.F.R. §1502.1. To ensure this important objective, a final EIS must provide responses to the substantive comments received during draft EIS review. Minn. R. 4410.2800, Subp. 4(B). The EIS must also disclose and respond to any responsible opposing view. Minn. R. 4410.2700, Subp. 1; 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(b); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Forest Service, 349 F. 3d 1157, 1167-1168 (9th Cir. 2003). Data and analyses in an EIS must be commensurate with the importance of the impact and the relevance of the information to a reasoned choice among alternatives and the consideration of the need for mitigation measures. Minn. R. 4410.2300(H). Impacts must be discussed in proportion to their significance, so the EIS concentrates on the issues that are truly significant to the action in question, rather than amassing needless detail. 40 U.S.C. §1500.1(b), §1502.2(b). An EIS must provide a thorough discussion of both direct and indirect potentially significant beneficial or adverse effects. Minn. R. 4410.2300(H); 40 C.F.R. §1502.16(a), (b). In describing adverse effects, an EIS may not use a listing of mitigation measures and an unsupported assumption of their success to conclude that effects of a proposed action will be minimal. Kentucky Riverkeeper v. Rowlette, 714 F. 3d 402 (6th Cir. 2013); Ohio Valley Envtl. Coalition v. Hurst, 604 F. Supp. 2d 860 (S. D. W. Va., 2009). An EIS must meet basic standards for quality. Environmental impact statements are required to be analytic rather than encyclopedic. Statements must be concise, clear, and to the point, and must be supported by evidence that the agency has made the necessary environmental analyses. 40 C.F.R. §§1500.4(b); 1502.1; 1502.2(a). “The information must be of high quality. Accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA.” 40 C.F.R. §1500.1(b).",NEPA,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"These requirements have been specifically applied to modeling. An EIS may not manipulate models, rely on flawed mitigation analysis, work backwards to achieve a desired result, or otherwise use scientifically unsound analyses to draw conclusions as to the environmental impacts of a proposal. See Environmental Defense v. U. S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 515 F. Supp. 2d 69, 74 (D.D.C., 2007), appeal dismissed, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 28182 (D.C. Cir, Oct. 10, 2008). NEPA requires up- front disclosures of relevant shortcomings in the data or models. See Lands Council v.

Paula Maccabee,"In addition, an agency cannot exclude pertinent information from an EIS. The EIS must include information relevant to reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts and a choice among alternatives if the information can be obtained within the state of the art and costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant. Minn. R. 4410.2500; 40 C.F.R. § 1502.22(b). Under NEPA, an EIS must include in its analysis reasonably foreseeable impacts that have catastrophic consequences even if their probability is low, provided that the analysis of the impacts is supported by credible scientific evidence, is not based on pure conjecture and is within the rule of reason. 40 C.F.R. §1502.22(b). An EIS must also meet basic standards of independence and integrity. An EIS cannot be based on conclusory statements of a project proponent, unsupported by substantial evidence. See CARD v. Kandiyohi, supra, 713 N.W. 2d at 837, fn. 18. “Agencies shall insure the professional integrity, including scientific integrity, of the discussions and analyses in the EIS” and “shall identify any methodologies used and shall make explicit reference by footnote to the scientific and other sources relied upon for conclusions.” 40 C.F.R. §1502.246",NEPA,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"One of the most significant roles the EIS must play is to facilitate the consideration of alternatives. An EIS must discuss appropriate alternatives to the action and their impacts and must compare the potentially significant impacts of the proposal with those of other reasonable alternatives to the proposed project. Minn. Stat. 116D.04, Subd. 2a; Minn. R. 4410.2300(G); 42 U.S.C. §4332(C)(iii) and (E); 40 C.F.R. §1502.1. Under NEPA, the alternatives section of the EIS related to alternatives is “the heart of the environmental impact statement.” The EIS “Should present the environmental impacts of the proposal and the alternatives in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options by the decisionmaker and the public.” 40 C.F.R. §1502.14. The EIS must (a) Rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives, and for alternatives which were eliminated from detailed study, briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated, and (b) Devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail including the proposed action so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits. Id. Under MEPA, The EIS must address one or more alternatives of each of the following types of alternatives or explain why no alternative of a particular type is included in the EIS: alternative sites, alternative technologies, modified designs, modified scale or magnitude, and alternatives incorporating reasonable mitigation measures identified through comments received during the comment periods for EIS scoping or for the draft EIS. Minn. R. 4410.2300(G).",NEPA,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"An EIS must also analyze adverse impacts of a proposed action in conjunction with other environmental impacts. An EIS must provide a thorough discussion of potentially significant beneficial or adverse cumulative effects. Minn. R. 4410.2300(H). This analysis includes cumulative impacts that result from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other actions.

Paula Maccabee,"The only change made in the PolyMet NorthMet project in response to WaterLegacy’s comments regarding mercury is that the project no longer proposes to use untreated high mercury Colby Lake water for stream augmentation in the wetlands complex north of the tailings waste facility, identified in the SDEIS as a high-risk location for mercury methylation. The FEIS states that Colby Lake water will be treated at the tailings site wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) prior to use for stream augmentation (FEIS, 2-10). However, the benefit of this change is uncertain, since the FEIS fails to analyze how mercury inputs from Colby Lake water transfer would affect tailings pond, tailings seepage and the WWTP. These impacts are likely to be significant. Colby Lake water mercury concentrations substantially exceed the Great Lakes Initiative (GLI) and Minnesota water quality standard of 1.3 nanograms per liter (ng/L). Data provided in the FEIS state total mercury concentrations in Colby Lake are between 4.6 and 8.7 ng/L, averaging 6.0 ng/L (FEIS, 4-37 to 4-38). During operations, maximum plant site water appropriation of water from Colby Lake would be 15.1 million gallons per day (MGD) or 1,300 million gallons per year (MGY) (FEIS, 5-201, Table 5.2.2-40). This maximum is equivalent to 10,486 gallons per minute (gpm) from Colby Lake. Despite the high concentration of mercury in Colby Lake water and the volume of Colby Lake water that would be piped to the plant site, the FEIS’ estimate of mercury in the inflows to the WWTP (FEIS, 5-230, Table 5.2.2-51) does not consider mercury inputs from Colby Lake water. Comparing the FEIS Table for Estimated Mercury Concentration of the Combined Inflows to the Plant Site WWTP to the same Table in the SDEIS (SDEIS, 5-206, Table 5.2.2-52), no adjustment has been made for an increased mercury concentration resulting from the need to treat Colby Lake water. The FEIS’ prediction that the combined inflows to the WWTP will have a mercury concentration of precisely 1.3 ng/L, the GLI water quality standard, is unchanged. This prediction does not seem to reflect analysis, since the maximum volume of Colby Lake water (average mercury concentration of 6.0 ng/L) is estimated at more than four times the 2,425 gpm total combined stream inflow to the WWTP predicted in the FEIS (FEIS, 5-230, Table 5.2.2-51). The FEIS’ failure to assess the ramifications of high- mercury Colby Lake water inputs is exacerbated by unsubstantiated assertions in the FEIS that the PolyMet NorthMet WWTP will be able to treat mercury through reverse osmosis or “equivalently performing technology” so that effluent will not exceed 1.3 ng/L (FEIS, 5-230, 5-238).",MERC,S,N,8,Barr 2013f Table 29; SDEIS Theme MERC 01. All surface water would be captured at the toe and treated before being discharged. The mercury
Paula Maccabee,"No references are provided for the FEIS’ conclusions about mercury treatment, but in various other places the FEIS cites PolyMet’s “pilot testing” of reverse osmosis to reassure the reader that water quality standards would be met for all constituents of interest at both the WWTP and the mine site wastewater treatment facility (WWTF), once the latter facility is upgraded to a reverse osmosis or equivalent technology in approximately year 52 (FEIS, 3-65, 5- 104, 5-147, 5-170, 5, A- 639). On closer review, the reference to a pilot test for PolyMet NorthMet mine pollution treatment is somewhat of a misnomer, particularly as applied to mercury reduction. The single pilot test report cited in the FEIS is a Barr document (FEIS ref. Barr 2013f). This report does not substantiate the efficacy of NorthMet wastewater treatment to remove mercury in compliance with the 1.3 ng/L standard. The PolyMet pilot test was conducted on water drawn from a seep and an aquifer well at the existing LTVSMC taconite tailings waste facility (Barr 2013f, p. 11). Mercury was below detectible levels in the influent for the test (Id., autop. 64-69, Table 1, Table 2). The only conclusions regarding mercury in Barr report were based on literature and an inquiry to the membrane supplier. Barr reported, “Mercury removal by RO membranes is highly dependent on the type of membrane used. Mercury rejections [the percentage removed by treatment] ranging from 22 to 99.9% have been reported,” (Id., p. 39). The report continued, “Mercury removal by RO is highly variable and dependent upon its speciation and the membrane selection. For these reasons, its removal is difficult to quantify,” (Id., p. 41). Should mercury influent to the WWTP exceed 1.3 ng/L, the FEIS does not provide any basis to conclude that water quality treatment will result in compliance with the 1.3 ng/L GLI and Minnesota water quality standard for mercury.",WAT,S,N,3,Barr Eng.

Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS asserts with incomprehensible precision that mercury loading in the Partridge River would decrease from 24.2 to 23 grams per year as a result of the PolyMet NorthMet mine project, more offsetting the 0.2 gram increase (from 22.3 to 22.5 grams per year) in mercury loading to the Embarrass River (FEIS, ES-36, 5-462). The FEIS has neither recognized nor responded to concerns about inadequate analysis of mercury air deposition and mercury seepage to substantiate this central claim.",MERC,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes AIR 06, MERC 13"
Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS still states, “Mercury air emissions and subsequent mercury deposition were not assessed for the Mine Site because potential emissions are less than 1.0 lb/yr,” (FEIS, p. 5- 462). The FEIS does not acknowledge that 1.0 pound per year is equivalent to 453.6 grams per year. This is an astronomical number when compared to the FEIS’ mercury loading offset calculations. If far less than one percent of NorthMet mine site mercury deposition found its way into the Partridge River, the net effect of the NorthMet project, with no other revisions or corrections, would increase mercury loading to the St. Louis River. Similarly, the FEIS failed to address concerns raised by WaterLegacy regarding mercury deposition near the NorthMet plant site. The FEIS cites the PolyMet Project Air Data Package (PolyMet 2015e) as its primary reference on mercury deposition. This PolyMet document states that the plant will emit 4.6 pounds per year of mercury and describes two scenarios for mercury speciation that affect local deposition, since oxidized mercury can “deposit readily” at a local and regional level and that some particle-bound mercury may also be deposited locally (PolyMet 2015e, autop.1042). If only 25% of mercury is elemental, the more conservative assumption, up to 3.68 pounds or 1,669.2 grams of NorthMet plant site mercury emissions may be deposited locally each year, within a 10-kilometer radius of the plant site (Id., Appendix C to Attachment U, p. 2, autop. 1091). PolyMet 2015e and the corresponding section of the FEIS analyze the effects of local plant site mercury deposition on the mercury Hazard Quotient in the Embarrass River chain of lakes. Yet, as with the mine site mercury deposition, the FEIS does not evaluate the effects that even a small fragment of the potentially 1,669.2 grams of mercury locally deposited would have on a mass loading calculation that claims mercury in the Embarrass River will only increase by 0.2 grams per year as a result of the PolyMet NorthMet project.",MERC,S,N,8,RS38B.

Paula Maccabee,"Next, the FEIS mischaracterized applicable data to claim that mercury in tailings would be adsorbed to tailings. Discrepancies between claims in the PolyMet NorthMet SDEIS regarding mercury and mercury data in underlying documents were not resolved in the FEIS. The FEIS goes even further than the SDEIS in asserting “the ability of NorthMet tailings to adsorb mercury, in combination with the proven ability of the underlying taconite tailings to adsorb mercury, is expected to result in an overall increase in the adsorption of mercury and subsequent lower concentrations of mercury at the Tailings Basin with the addition of the NorthMet tailings,” (FEIS, 5-229). As explained in WaterLegacy’s SDEIS comments, this optimistic claim mischaracterizes the NTS bench study cited in the FEIS. The FEIS reports that the 2006 NTS bench study reduced mercury concentrations by 73 percent (from 3.3 ng/L to 0.9 ng/L) after 480 minutes. And, as in the SDEIS, the FEIS fails to disclose either that the plain water in a control flask reduced mercury concentrations by 22 percent in that timeframe or that the trend in the experiment, when it was discontinued after eight hours, was that the mercury was desorbing from the tailings and may have doubled since the fourth hour of the experiment when mercury was beneath the detection limit of 0.5 ng/L (FEIS reference Barr 2007d, autop. 157, 160).4 Even more problematic, the FEIS’ assertion that adsorption of mercury by the existing LTVSMC tailings has been “proven” is inconsistent with the data and assertions in Section 4.0 of the FEIS itself. The FEIS states, Comparing the existing Cell 2E pond water quality with water quality at the toe of the Tailings Basin can define the effect that passage through the existing LTVSMC tailings has on seepage water quality. Such comparison shows that passage through the LTVSMC tailings apparently reduces the average concentrations of arsenic, fluoride, and molybdenum, although it is difficult to determine to what extent these reductions are simply attributable to the effects of dilution. The concentrations of several other parameters, such as calcium, manganese, nickel, and TDS, increase as they seep from the tailings pond to the toe of the Tailings Basin. (FEIS, 4-127) The FEIS narrative does not state how mercury concentrations are affected as they pass through the existing LTVSMC tailings, but the data is clear. Mercury in the existing Cell 2E pond has a mean concentration of 1.4 ng/L. Mercury in the toe of the existing tailings facility has a mean concentration of 4.9 ng/L (FEIS, 4-126, Table 4.2.2-23) Using simple arithmetic, the FEIS has proved that in passing through the existing LTVSMC tailings mean mercury more than triples.",MERC,S,N,8,"SDEIS Theme MERC 06. A simple arithmetic comparison of means does not represent the processes impacting mercury concentrations as water flows through the tailings. Specifically, the mean well data are from a different time period (2007-2013) than the mean pond data (2001-2004), and therefore a direct relationship between the two cannot be drawn. It should also be noted that the pond sampling for mercury occurred from 4 to 11 years before the toe well sampling and, depending on hydrologic properties of the tailings, may not represent the starting pond composition of the water collected in the toe wells.

Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS, like the SDEIS text criticized in WaterLegacy’s prior comments, also understates potential mercury impacts from mercury in the West Pit. The FEIS claims a 92 percent burial rate for the total mercury load in the West Pit (FEIS, 5-226, Table 5.2.2-49 Initial and Final Parameter Values for the Mercury Mass Balance). The underlying literature cited, in fact, estimates actual mercury sedimentation rates at 80 to 90% (FEIS ref. PolyMet 2015m, p. 325). More important, the FEIS’ use of the term “burial” suggests that mercury in the West Pit would become permanently unavailable. The FEIS fails to discuss the well-established risk that mercury concentrated in lake sediments will cycle in and out of suspension, become methylated and bioaccumulate, affecting fish and wildlife.6 The FEIS’ has again failed to provide high-quality mercury information, has failed to model mercury releases and has selectively reported mercury data.",MERC,S,N,8,"PolyMet 2015m pg. 325. The NorthMet ore and waste rock contain trace amounts of mercury, but mass balance modeling and analog data from other natural lakes and mine pit lakes in northeastern Minnesota suggest that the mercury concentration in the West Pit Lake would stabilize at approximately 0.9 ng/L, which is a value that accounts for the mercury cycling identified in the comment."
Paula Maccabee,"WaterLegacy’s prior comments in the SDEIS raise raised concerns about the implications on mercury methylation of unsubstantiated assumptions that 99.5 percent of seepage from the unlined tailings waste facility and more than 90 percent of seepage from the unlined Category 1 waste rock pile would be captured without effect on the environment. The FEIS uses the same unsupportable seepage capture assumptions and modeling. These assumptions substantially understate the potential for sulfate seepage, indirect discharge to surface waters and increases in mercury methylation both near the project site and downstream in St. Louis River sediments.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS COOP Response #2389.

Paula Maccabee,"WaterLegacy has previously objected to use of projections of existing conditions as a baseline to evaluate NorthMet project impacts on water quality. This concern is discussed in more detail in Section XI, infra in addressing Alternatives, including the No Action Alternative. The FEIS makes the same strategic comparison to suggest that the NorthMet project would reduce sulfate discharge to receiving waters and the resulting potential for mercury methylation, when the opposite is more likely to be true. The FEIS compares NorthMet project impacts to the Continuation of Existing Conditions (CEC) scenario, even as it admits that the CEC model “does not include future expected additional mitigation such as water quality mitigation at the existing LTVSMC Tailings Basin,” (FEIS, 5-94). The FEIS acknowledges that water quality would improve if the project did not take place: “Seepage water quality from the existing LTVSMC Tailings Basin would be expected to improve over time as a result of the Cliffs Erie Consent Decree, other permit requirements (e.g., Permit to Mine), and natural attenuation of Contaminants,” (ES-49). The FEIS states that the NorthMet project would reduce sulfate loading by more than 40 percent in the Embarrass River at PM-13. (FEIS, 6-48), relying on an unsubstantiated nearly perfect tailings seepage collection rate of 99.5 percent. The FEIS did not estimate sulfate reduction achievable through natural attenuation and seepage collection by Cliffs Erie at the existing LTVSMC as a result of regulatory controls. Failing to do so biased the analysis of the NorthMet project’s impact on increased sulfate discharge and the resulting potential for mercury methylation.",ALT,S,N,8,"The use of the CEC is a practical tool to model changes to the affected environment when future conditions without the project are not accurately quantifiable over time.

Paula Maccabee,"The EPA, in comments on the SDEIS, recommended that the FEIS model mercury using either GoldSim or a more suitable model, such as the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP)3, which is commonly used by EPA to model elemental mercury.

(Branfireun, 2014).8 The FEIS contains no modeling of mercury other than the simplistic mass balance analysis effectively dismissed as unusable by Dr. Branfireun below. Mercury has not been included in the GoldSim modeling for the NorthMet mine site or the plant site (FEIS, 5-223, 5-228), and no other model was used to model either mercury or methylmercury increases .",MERC,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme MERC 13

Dr. Branfireun’s expert opinion, summarized below, explains the need to assess scientifically recognized impacts of sulfate discharge and deposition and hydrological effects on wetlands and sediments in increasing mercury methylation.",MERC,S,O,8,USGS 2010
Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS provides more data on the various types of sulfur-containing air emissions, spillage and dust from the NorthMet mine site and plant site and more text explaining the potential relationship between sulfate deposition and mercury methylation than did the SDEIS. However, rather than using this data to provide a critical analysis of the aggregate impacts of these various forms of sulfate in methylating environments – namely the wetlands closest to the deposition sources - the FEIS obscures and negates the potential impacts of local sulfur inputs on mercury methylation. The FEIS states that the NorthMet plant site would emit about 7 tons per year of sulfur dioxide, and about 1.9 tons per year of sulfur dioxide from the mine site (FEIS, 5-509). FEIS modeling then focuses on two lakes at least five miles away from the plant site and farther yet from the mine site (Colby Lake and Sabin Lake). The FEIS predicts that sulfur dioxide deposition would increase by 2 percent in each lake (FEIS, 5-510). The FEIS provides no estimates of impacts on wetlands, the methylating environments located proximate to sulfur dioxide sources. The FEIS then discusses sulfuric acid mist, emissions of which are estimated to be slightly more than 5 tons per year (FEIS, 5-510). Again, the FEIS only models deposition on the two lakes a considerable distance from the site, and dismisses deposition of sulfuric acid mist as a small percentage over the watersheds (Id.) Next, the FEIS discusses reduced sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide (1.88 tons per year) and carbon disulfide (5.1 tons per year) with a total volume of 6.98 tons per year from the NorthMet plant site. The FEIS does not estimate the potential deposition of sulfur from reduced sulfur compounds, saying the local deposition “is uncertain, but it is not expected to exceed evaluation criteria,” (Id.). Finally, the FEIS discusses sulfur in particulate matter that would be emitted from the plant site. Again, focusing on Colby Lake and Sabin Lake, but without disclosing the tons per year emitted, the FEIS predicts that deposition of sulfate in particulate matter would be 4 percent of background, once more deemed a small percentage of background. (FEIS, 5-510 to 5-511). However, here the FEIS provides an important additional analysis. Based on the assumption that all sulfur in fugitive dust converts to sulfate and mixes with surface water in wetlands. Assuming that all sulfur in fugitive dust converts to sulfate and mixes with surface water in wetlands, the FEIS predicts a potential increase in wetlands sulfate concentrations of 4.2 mg/L. (FEIS, 5-339)",MERC,S,N,8,"SDEIS Theme MERC 08.  It is correct that the Final EIS analysis does not include specific discussions on SO2 or sulfur aerosol mist (SAM) impacts to “wetlands,” although it does include discussion on impacts to lakes. The Final EIS does, however, include a discussion of the impacts to wetlands from the larger source of sulfur from particulates and fugitive dust (> approximately 80% of calculated potential sulfate additions). Considering another qualitative, but smaller, increment from SO2 and/or SAM to the quantitative impact analysis already conducted for particulate sulfur on wetlands in the FEIS does not change the overall conclusions of that analysis.  Emissions of mercury from the mine would be addressed in permitting. MPCA would determine, in the course of its decision-making for a permit governing air emissions, what regulations or controls should be imposed upon potential sources of mercury that could impact water resources, including fugitive emissions. Similarly, potential water quality concerns associated with mercury, sulfate, and methylmercury, would be addressed in the context of NPDES permitting as well as wetlands permitting, which could include the details of potential water quality monitoring."
Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS admits, “small sulfate increases in sulfate-poor wetlands would be expected to increase the production of methylmercury in wetlands,” (FEIS, 5-164). But the FEIS fails to explain that the three Upper Partridge tributary streams that drain relatively undisturbed watersheds --Wetlegs Creek, proposed West Pit Outlet Creek and Longnose Creek (FEIS, 4-83) -- reflect drainage from low-sulfate wetlands. Even according to the revised data in the FEIS, sulfate concentrations are 3.9 mg/L for Wetlegs Creek, 2.6 mg/L for proposed West Pit Outlet Creek and 0.91 mg/L for Longnose Creek (FEIS, 4-84).9 Increased wetlands concentrations from fugitive dust alone, without considering ore spillage or sulfur-compound air deposition would more than double sulfate in all three undisturbed mine site creek watersheds and more than quadruple sulfate in the Longnose Creek watershed. It is undeniable, based solely on FEIS data, that mine site sulfate deposition would be expected to increase the production of methylmercury in mine site wetlands. Dr. Branfireun’s opinion below calculates sulfate deposition from dust as sulfate loading and concludes that sulfate deposition of this magnitude could nearly double methylation in affected wetlands. However, even his analysis is likely to understate potential impacts of sulfate deposition on wetlands, since the FEIS does not provide sufficient high quality data to aggregate the various sulfur-containing emissions or the combined impacts of sulfur-containing emissions, ore spillage and dust on the nearest or most ecologically sensitive waters.",MERC,S,O,8,FEIS pg. 5-313
Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS’ discussion of sulfur deposition as a result of spillage and dust are provided in other sections of the document. This discussion minimizes the impacts of ore spillage. The FEIS accepts as fact PolyMet’s assertion that refurbishing old rail cars (at about one-sixth the cost of new rail cars) would reduce potential spillage from each car to 0.2 tons per year, a 97 percent reduction from the original calculation of 6.14 tons per year potential spillage from each car (FEIS, 5-164, citing PolyMet 2014a). The Co-Lead Agencies do not require verification that refurbishment will succeed; they simply assert the position taken in the SDEIS that no impacts from rail car spillage and dust on wetlands and streams are expected (FEIS, 8- 24). The FEIS states that surface water quality in the mine site Upper Partridge tributary streams (Wetlegs Creek, Longnose Creek, proposed West Pit Outlet Creek and Wyman Creek) “would be affected by ore spillage from the rail cars,” but fails to analyze either the magnitude of this effect or the impacts of ore spillage on wetlands and mercury methylation.(FEIS, 5-164) Approximately 543 acres of wetlands along the railroad corridor could be affected by rainfall contacting spilled ore and fines and releasing solutes (FEIS, 5-314).",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WET 11
Paula Maccabee,"As explained in WaterLegacy’s comments on the SDEIS, assessment of sulfate impacts on methylation in mine site wetlands should also consider the potential that mine site seepage in the surficial aquifer will daylight in wetlands. At the mine site, although predictions have been changed since the SDEIS to model fewer project impacts as compared to continuation of existing conditions,10 at P90 sulfate is predicted to more than triple along the overburden storage and laydown flowpath and along the West Pit flowpath (FEIS, 5-129, Table 5.2.2-23). There are 516 acres of wetlands within the mine site surficial aquifer flowpaths (FEIS, 5-320; Table 5.2.3-7). Rather than recognizing that the NorthMet project would increase production of methylmercury as a result of sulfate in wetlands adjacent to the mine site, the FEIS minimizes this significant environmental impact, stating “methylmercury produced in wetlands is not necessarily incorporated into food chains and concentrated to levels of concern” and proposing that the potential incremental change in methylation “may warrant future monitoring.” (FEIS, 5-339)",WAT,S,O,8,NorthMet EIS Groundwater IAP Final Summary Memo. FEIS pgs. 5-319 to 5-320
Paula Maccabee,"These statements contradict the purpose of an EIS and basic scientific integrity. It is beyond dispute that methylmercury is exported to streams as they pass through wetlands and that precipitation events and seasonal wetting cycles release methylmercury from peatlands into streams where that methylmercury can be incorporated into food chains. In fact, these points are both made in a recent Report of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), one of the Co-Lead agencies preparing the FEIS.11 The FEIS does not discuss the potential that hydrologic changes resulting from mine dewatering and tailings seepage capture would increase mercury methylation. Dr. Branfireun’s opinion below explains the effects of drying and rewetting cycles in increasing mercury methylation in wetland and peatland environments. Given potential mine site drawdown impacts on as much as 5,720 acres of wetlands (Section V, infra) and the combined impacts of sulfate loading and drying and wetting cycles, the methylation processes described by Dr. Branfireun presents a significant risk. Despite statements of concern regarding methylmercury by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Tribal Cooperating Agencies,12 as well as by WaterLegacy and medical organizations (see Exhibit 18, attached), the FEIS still makes no effort to analyze potential methylmercury effects from the NorthMet project. As Dr. Branfireun’s expert opinions explain, the NorthMet mine, processing plant, waste facilities and ponds create conditions that increase production of methylmercury, including discharge and deposition of mercury, discharge and deposition of sulfate, and drying and rewetting of wetlands at both the mine site and tailings site.

Without qualifying its conclusions to explain the limited analysis done, the FEIS goes yet farther than any prior EIS document to broadly dismiss methylmercury human health concerns on the basis of the small increases in this limited analysis; “Given that evidence and finding, no potential change in human health risks related to the fish consumption pathway is expected,” (FEIS, 7-16). The simultaneous failure to analyze methylmercury production in the FEIS and its categorical denial of methylmercury effects is unacceptable under either NEPA or MEPA environmental assessment laws. Denial that the NorthMet sulfide mine project will increase mercury and production of methylmercury results in the continued failure of the FEIS to consider adverse effects of the Proposed Project on water quality, human health, tribal treaty and reservation resources or environmental justice.

Even with these uncertainties in the analyses there is still high confidence in the overall determination presented in the Final EIS that the project will not result in adverse effects on downstream fish-tissue mercury levels or on the associated human health concerns of fish consumption. By reducing the contribution of sulfate in the Embarrass River watershed relative to current levels, the project is also consistent with the goals of the MPCA strategy (2006a) to address the indirect effects of sulfate on methyl mercury production for ""high risk"" settings such as exists over portions of the NorthMet project area."
Paula Maccabee,"Dr. Branfireun also concluded, based on the methylmercury data in the Partridge and Embarrass Rivers and in mine site creeks, that the NorthMet project area is a highly methylating environment, making these watersheds sensitive both to hydrological impacts due to changes in surface or subsurface hydrology and to additional sulfate either from surface water or deposition.

He explained that the sulfate limit of 10 mg/L to protect wild rice may still allow increased methylation to take place in wetlands or tributary catchments and that the mine site creeks demonstrate sulfate-limited conditions with a high potential for mercury methylation, where “even small additions of sulfate to sulfate-poor wetlands can increase methylmercury production.” (Id., pp. 9-12).

The next section of Dr. Branfireun’s opinion recent applied peer-reviewed research to conclude that “stimulation of methylmercury production by the rewetting process is a ubiquitous process” in Minnesota bog-type wetlands and that “we must expect that a significant proportion of bog wetlands that are within the zone of drawdown from the proposed mine development will also exhibit sulfate regeneration and increased export of methylmercury, under natural rewetting cycles as well as storm events.” (Id., pp. 20- 21). Hydrologic changes as a result of drying and rewetting would promote methylation as well as contribute to repeat flushes of methylmercury and inorganic mercury from the proposed unlined mine site storage area. Dewatering of wetlands surrounding the tailings basin through seepage collection and even modest impacts on the water table resulting from dewatering could increase total mercury, methylmercury and sulfate in the Partridge, Embarrass and ultimately, the St. Louis River. (Id., p. 22). Dr. Branfireun applied recent peer-reviewed research to estimate impacts of sulfate deposition in methylation at mine site wetlands. Using background and deposition rates from Barr and PolyMet documents, Dr. Branfireun calculated that the increased sulfate loading resulting from the NorthMet proposal is, in fact 3.76 times background deposition. Based on results in experimental peatlands, he calculated that mercury export from sensitive peatlands near the mine site may increase up to 1.88 times. Given the magnitude of this potential impact, even if less than all sulfur is liberated to the environment as sulfate, there will still be a substantial stimulatory effect on peatland mercury methylation.

Finally, even if appropriate monitoring for biogeochemical changes in wetlands and sediments near the development were to be designed and implemented (a difficult and complex undertaking requiring collection of baseline data not supplied in the FEIS), it is highly likely that lag times for expression of methylmercury increases, multiple mechanisms of transport, and the likelihood of legacy regeneration of sulfate stored in the watershed would preclude effective adaptive management prior to irreversible impairment of downstream waters.

The FEIS’ claims that the NorthMet mine would not violate water quality standards or would not increase the violations beyond the “continuation of existing conditions” scenario are based on these improper qualifications of the data as well as the unsupported assumptions of its modeling.

Paula Maccabee,"WaterLegacy’s FEIS comments in this Section focus on mine site hydrogeology, and concerns raised in the expert opinions of Dr. Lee and geologist J.D. Lehr on the SDEIS. Our concerns have been exacerbated, rather than resolved, as a result of additional disclosures and investigations since the SDEIS was released and treatment of hydrogeology and water modeling issues in the FEIS. As a result of concerns about the completeness, accuracy and reliability of water modeling performed to date for the PolyMet NorthMet sulfide mine project and about the potential harm that would result from the project, WaterLegacy requests that federal agencies and state reviewers of the FEIS require that independent water quality modeling for the project be performed by the U. S. Geologic Survey or other undisputed experts.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"The connection between water in surficial materials and groundwater at the mine site is an important determinant of wetland drawdown impacts from mine dewatering and may affect water quality impacts on surface waters, groundwater and wetlands. When the SDEIS was released, geologist J.D. Lehr (Lehr, 2014) challenged its conclusion that there was a “weak” connection between bedrock groundwater and surficial water and its claims that a single 30-day pump test was sufficient: • The single 30-day pump test cited in the SDEIS is insufficient to infer that there is a “weak” hydrologic connection between bedrock and surficial deposits. • It is likely that there would be would be significant interaction between ground water in surficial materials and bedrock along the lateral trends of bedrock fractures. It is undisputed that the FEIS still relies only a single 30-day pumping test conducted in 2006 at bedrock well P-2 to conclude that the “small amount of drawdown in the nearest deep wetland piezometer, and no detectable drawdown at other water table or deep piezometers” demonstrated “the hydraulic connection between surficial deposits and the underlying bedrock, although present, is weak or non-existent” and that there is a “general lack of interaction between the surficial and bedrock aquifers.” (FEIS, 4-47, 4-53, 4-173, 4-174). Since the SDEIS was released, newly prepared and released documents call into question the sufficiency and scientific reliability of the P-2 pump test on which the FEIS relies to minimize the connection between the mine site surficial aquifer and groundwater. The location of the P-2 pump test is shown in FEIS Figure 4.2.2-8, attached as Exhibit 2. Reviewing FEIS Figure 4.2.2-8 alongside Large Figures 1 and 2 in the recent Barr Hydrogeology of Fractured Bedrock report (FEIS ref. Barr 2014b, Large Figures 1 and 2, provided as Exhibit 3), it seems that the P-2 test was located where it would be least likely to demonstrate a hydraulic connection. Although areas of high concern – the north side of the East Pit and the 100 Mile Swamp peatlands north of the East Pit -- are both located in more conductive Virginia Formation rock, the P-2 test was conducted at the edge of the rock unit for Duluth Complex. Conductivity data on Barr 2014b Large Figure 2 (Exhibit 3) illustrate the difference between Duluth Complex rock and Virginia Formation rock in the vicinity of the P-2 test. Hydraulic conductivity in Duluth Complex rock was measured between 1.3E-06 and 3.5E-06 centimeters per second and that of nearby Virginia Formation rock between 1.7E-05 to 2.5E-04 centimeters per second; hydraulic conductivity was up to 100 times greater in proximate Virginia Formation rock than the Duluth Complex rock. Barr Engineering’s report for PolyMet on the P-2 pumping test concluded that, with the exception of the deep piezometer located closest to the well, “the decrease in water levels in the piezometers are not attributed to pumping” and “significant and widespread drawdown of the water table within these deposits is not anticipated.” (Barr 2007a, p. 6, p.12). However, documents received through the Minnesota Data Practices Act show that both Tribal Cooperating Agencies and consultants for the MDNR disputed Barr’s conclusion that the RS10A pump test demonstrated a lack of wetlands impacts. GLIFWC’s John Coleman disagreed with Barr, stating that, “4 out the 5 wetland wells monitoring for drawdown showed noticeable drops in water level during the pump- test” and that “Although the pump-test was poorly designed and the results are ambiguous, if any conclusion could be made it would be the opposite of that stated in the report.” (John Coleman, GLIFWC emails to Stuart Arkley, MDNR, Sept. 10 -12, 2008, Exhibit 4). In addition, the MDNR’s own consultants, Jim Kunkel and Cory Conrad13 criticized both the conclusions and the methodology of the RS10A study. They concluded, “The bottom line is there was some impact on the wetlands and most likely other surface water bodies for this relatively short-term test.” (Reviewer Comments RS10A, Apr. 20, 2007, Exhibit 5). MDNR’s consultants urged additional analysis of distance-drawdown and vertical hydraulic conductivity between surficial deposits and bedrock to assess wetlands impacts. They proposed that the MODFLOW model should include a factor for surface water and groundwater interaction and, if MODFLOW could not calculate impacts to surface water during mine dewatering, a better conceptual model was needed. (Id.) A single pump test is insufficient to assess the connection between surficial deposits and bedrock, and a test solely in Duluth Complex rock seems calculated to understate the connection. Both Tribal Cooperating Agencies and MDNR’s reviewers challenged the conclusions of Barr’s consultants and recommended additional testing with better designs. Yet, seven years later, the FEIS still follows PolyMet’s lead and characterizes the P-2 pump test as demonstrating a “weak or non-existent” connection between mine site surface and groundwater without disclosing either the test’s design flaws or the scientific assessment that additional testing and modeling was needed. Both the P-2 test and the conclusions drawn from it in the FEIS fail to meet the requirements of scientific rigor, integrity and disclosure of opposing views required for an EIS.",WET,S,O,3,"PolyMet 2015b pg. 27-29.

Their opinions included the following: • Bedrock beneath the mine site is known to contain fractures and faults. Groundwater flow through bedrock occurs through fractures or other secondary porosity features. (Lehr, 2014)",WAT,NS,X,1,

Paula Maccabee,"• The numbers presented in Table 5.2.2--8 [similar to data in FEIS Table 5.2.2-8] show very small recharge fluxes for the East and West Pits. These rates can be no more than assumptions that are not justified. Not only are the materials in the East and West Pits fractured, their fractures are certain to be further enhanced by the blasting associated with open pit mining. The assumed low conductivities result in lowered fluxes of contaminants from the pits with reduced concentrations. The information contained in this Table is misleading.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 016
Paula Maccabee,"Although new illustrations showing the direction and location of fractures and bedrock mine site geology were provided in a Barr report (Barr 2014b, Figures 1 and 2, Exhibit 3), no such depiction of fractures appears anywhere in the 3,576-page FEIS. The FEIS still minimizes the potential impacts of fractures and focuses its discussion on the primary conductivity of Duluth Complex rock. (FEIS, 4-51 to 4-52) The FEIS agrees that secondary porosity affects groundwater flow (FEIS, 4-48), but provides no new testing or modeling of secondary porosity features or assessment of the impacts of these secondary channels as conduits for mine pollution.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 012
Paula Maccabee,"As the end of environmental review approached, PolyMet updated its modeling of hydraulic conductivity. The purpose of this exercise was not to evaluate pollution or wetlands impacts, but “to estimate transient flows to the mine pits during operations and subsequent closure.” (FEIS, p. 5-19, citing PolyMet 2015m). It is instructive. As a result of PolyMet’s new MODFLOW calibration, several bulk horizontal and vertical conductivity values changed between the SDEIS and the FEIS. Mean horizontal conductivity of wetland deposits increased to 400 percent of that calculated in the SDEIS (from 5.6 feet per day to 23.7 ft/day), as did both mean horizontal and mean vertical conductivity in lower Virginia Formation bedrock (from 0.019 ft/day to 0.079 ft/day for horizontal conductivity and from 0.0019 ft/day to 0.0079 ft/day for vertical conductivity). (Comparison is based on SDEIS, 5-27, Table 5.2.2-7 and FEIS, 5-29 Table 5.2.2-7). Updated estimates of groundwater inflow rates to the pits (FEIS, 5-511) are also significantly different from the predictions in the SDEIS. There are modest decreases for most years in the predicted inflow to the West Pit, with a maximum decrease of 20 gallons per minute (gpm) inflow. However, for the East Pit, as a result of recent recalibration of hydraulic conductivity for Virginia Formation bedrock, significant increases in inflows are predicted from year 1 through year 20. Total increased East Pit inflow for the 20 years increases by 5,890 gpm, with an average annual increased inflow of 294.5 gpm and an average annual percentage increase of nearly 300 percent (289%). (Comparison is based on SDEIS, 5-91, Table 5.2.2-18 with FEIS, 5-111, Table 5.2.2-19).",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"Although the FEIS is quick to deny that its newly-calibrated information could be used to predict mine site wetlands impacts due to the “complex geology with the presence of bedrock, surficial deposits, and wetland soils at the Mine Site” (FEIS, 5- 111), WaterLegacy remains unconvinced that modeling NorthMet drawdown impacts on wetlands is infeasible rather than just a potential source of inconvenient truth. Tribal Cooperating Agencies have long maintained that an uncalibrated analog approach should not be the only method used for evaluating drawdown impacts on wetlands. (FEIS, App. C, autop. 2985, 2994). In his review of the SDEIS, hydrologist Dr. Donald Lee bluntly rejected the argument that MODFLOW could not be used to evaluate NorthMet wetlands impacts. At this stage of the SDEIS, where MODFLOW has already been used extensively to evaluate the consequences of the proposed action, suggesting MODFLOW cannot be used for wetlands assessment discredits all of the preceding analysis of hydrology and water quality. Suggesting MODFLOW cannot be used because of the nature of the surficial deposits is to say MODFLOW has not been appropriate to evaluate all of the preceding impacts of the proposed action contained in the SDEIS. This internal contradiction is sufficient to reject the analysis of hydrology and water quality in the SDEIS as inadequate. (Lee, 2014, p. 12) Mercury and wetlands expert Dr. Brian Branfireun also opined that wetlands impact modeling should be completed for the PolyMet NorthMet mine project, The reliance on the analog case to evaluate the potential extent and magnitude of the cone of depression and dewatering impact of surface wetlands and streams is completely unsatisfactory, in my opinion, given the availability of robust hydrogeological models that could reasonably evaluate potential impact scenarios. (Branfireun, 2014, p. 14). At this point in the development of the NorthMet project, when PolyMet has recalibrated its models to accurately address inflow to pits during mining and water balance needs, denying that models are available to evaluate secondary wetlands impacts strains credulity.",WAT,S,O,8,PolyMet 2015b pg. 27-29.

Paula Maccabee,"New information on faults and hydraulic conductivity also underscores the need to effectively model impacts on water quality from the East and West mine pits. New mapping shows that inferred faults transect the locations where the West Pit and East Pit would be located. (Barr 2014b, Large Figures 1 and 2, Exhibit 3). The 100 Mile Swamp wetlands and the northern side of the East Pit are located in Virginia Formation bedrock. (Id.)

Paula Maccabee,"Neither the FEIS nor responses to comments addressed WaterLegacy’s comments or the opinion of Dr. Lee (Lee, 2014) that assumptions regarding seepage collection at the permanent, unlined Category 1 waste rock pile were unsubstantiated and unreasonable. The hydrogeologic conditions beneath the unlined Category 1 waste rock piles are not discussed in the FEIS. But comparing the Mine Site Plan (FEIS, Figure 4.2.14-1) with figures in the Barr Hydrogeology of Fractured Bedrock report (FEIS ref. Barr 2014b, Figures 1 and 2, Exhibit 3) shows that the majority of the Category 1 waste rock pile would be located on Virginia Formation rock, rather than less hydraulically conductive Duluth Complex rock. There are two faults confirmed by Barr and at least one additional inferred fault transecting the proposed site for the Category 1 waste rock pile. (Id.) The FEIS predicted, based on PolyMet’s modeling and assumptions (PolyMet 2015h), that more than 98 percent of affected groundwater seepage from the Category 1 stockpile would be captured by the containment system or would migrate as groundwater into the West Pit and East Pit. (FEIS, 5-7). PolyMet’s modeling (PolyMet 2015h), also adopted in the FEIS, predicted that only negligible volumes of uncaptured seepage would flow north. (FEIS, 5-65).",WAT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WR 017, WR 010. PolyMet 2015m Attachment B Section 4.1.3"
Paula Maccabee,"Reference documents undermine these claims for seepage collection. Although the FEIS refers to the containment to be installed to collect seepage as a “low-permeability cut-off wall keyed into bedrock” (FEIS, 5-7), the actual design provides for the use of “compacted soil” as a barrier around the waste rock pile. (FEIS ref. PolyMet 2015h, p. 10). Specifications for the hydraulic conductivity are 1 x 10-5 centimeters per second (Id., p. 13), which is generally classified as “semi-permeable” soil. The drainage system would consist of pipes and ditches and rely only on gravity for collection. (Id., p. 14). PolyMet admits that along the west, north, and east sides of the stockpile, there may be localized areas where the drain pipe cannot be installed at an elevation low enough to ensure that groundwater will not flow beneath the cutoff wall. (Id.)",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"Dr. Lee has summarized after reviewing PolyMet’s seepage collection plan, “the proposed drainage system is unlikely to work as anticipated.” (Lee, Category 1 stockpile opinion, 2015).",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS COOP Response #19649
Paula Maccabee,"Failures of engineering controls for seepage are not counted in PolyMet’s modeling. Instead, “PolyMet assumed that water collection performance monitoring points will be defined in SDS permitting to confirm (via monitoring differential hydraulic head) whether or not post-construction seepage loss is occurring beneath the cutoff wall. If monitoring confirms that seepage losses are occurring to an extent potentially detrimental to water quality, then groundwater recovery wells can be installed to supplement the containment system. (Id., emphasis added).",WAT,S,O,8,PolyMet 2015d Section 3.0
Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS’ predictions of minimal Category 1 seepage flow were also based on assumption that the cover placed on the rock pile would reduce infiltration by more than 99 percent (from 360 gpm to 2.8 gpm). (FEIS, 5-145). PolyMet’s document from which this conclusion is drawn admits that geomembranes have not been used for many waste rock stockpile covers and that use is generally limited to projects with an average size of less than 30 acres. (PolyMet 2015d, p. 45). Yet, PolyMet (2015d) and the FEIS calculate infiltration solely on the basis of liner defects per acre of liners, without considering the topography of massive waste rock piles. PolyMet identifies three mine sites where geomembranes have been used as a cover, but does not describe seepage results. One of these featured sites is the Dunka Mine (Id., p. 46). Unsurprisingly, the FEIS does not cite the Dunka Mine in its predictions that infiltration and seepage will be prevented. Despite its geomembrane, Dunka Mine waste rock seepage has resulted and continues to result in ongoing violations of Minnesota water quality standards for copper, nickel, hardness and specific conductivity.

Paula Maccabee,"Prior comments by WaterLegacy and expert opinions of J.D. Lehr and Donald Lee disputed assertions in the SDEIS that all PolyMet NorthMet mine site surficial aquifer flow would migrate to the south or southwest. J.D. Lehr cited a PolyMet technical document (SDEIS reference PolyMet 2012s, Figure 2-3) showing flowpaths from the mine site north to Yelp Creek and the 100 Mile Swamp with travel times of 1-10 years. (Lehr, 2014, p. 30). Dr. Lee noted the fact that existing runoff from the northernmost part of the mine site currently drains north to the 100 Mile Swamp and stated that absent explanation or analysis, any conclusion excluding northern surficial flow was “simply unjustified.” (Lee, 2014, pp. 6, 12)",WAT,S,O,8,FEIS pg. 5-65
Paula Maccabee,"When the SDEIS was released, neither WaterLegacy nor the experts we consulted were aware that there was a risk that groundwater would flow north from the East Pit and across the Laurentian Divide to the Rainy River Basin. That changed in October 2014 when a proposal was submitted by Northshore Mining Company (Northshore) for a 108-acre expansion into high sulfur rock at the Peter Mitchell Pit. The Environmental Assessment Worksheet (EAW) for the Northshore expansion (Northshore EAW 2014, Exhibit 6) established that Northshore had already removed the pillar within the Peter Mitchell Pit that historically separated the two watersheds, maintaining the divide only by the placement and operation of pit sumps. (Id., p. 8). The EAW stated that the maximum level of the pit lake at mine closure would be 1,500 feet above mean sea level (AMSL) and that the outfall from the low point at the east end of the Peter Mitchell pit would discharge to the Dunka River in the Rainy River Basin. (Id., p. 5). Barr Engineering maps provided by MDNR in connection with the Northshore expansion (Barr Maps 12 and 13, Current and Post-Closure Pit Stratigraphy, Exhibit 7) showed current Peter Mitchell Pit depth of approximately 1,550 feet AMSL at its lowest point and planned expanding depth to less than 1,300 feet AMSL. (Id.)",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"Not only had the MDNR allowed the Northshore Mining Company to do away with the watershed divide between the Lake Superior and Rainy River Basin. The planned expansion promised a significant increase in the hydraulic gradient from the NorthMet mine site down to the base of the Peter Mitchell Pit and the potential for inter-Basin transfer of water and contaminants from the Lake Superior Basin to the Rainy River Basin. As part of work on behalf of Tribal Cooperating Agencies to analyze mine site groundwater baseflow, GLIFWC examined documents related to historic and future Peter Mitchell Pit levels. GLIFWC then communicated to Co-Lead Agencies that PolyMet’s most recent baseflow modeling erroneously assumed that water flowed out from rather than into the Peter Mitchell Pit from 1979 to 1988, resulting in an inaccurately low assessment of base flow groundwater in the upper Partridge River. (GLIFWC letter to Co-Lead Agencies Northward Flowpath & Groundwater Modeling, Aug. 11, 2015 with attachments and figures, Exhibit 8) Reviewing the expansion and closure plans for the Northshore Mine in conjunction with the PolyMet NorthMet project, GLIFWC informed the Co-Lead Agencies that “detailed (MODFLOW) and simplistic (MathCad) models predict that a northward contaminant flowpath is probable under likely closure conditions.” (Id., p. 1). GLIFWC provided attachments and figures with the August 2015 Northward Flowpath letter to illustrate both the errors in baseflow modeling and the new prediction of northward groundwater flow, given the water levels expected at closure of the Peter Mitchell Pit. GLIFWC explained that water flows downhill and that the base of the Peter Mitchell Pit at closure and the surface elevation of the Peter Mitchell Pit lake under long-term reclamation would draw groundwater from NorthMet mine site features, particularly the backfilled East Pit. The hydraulic gradient would result in groundwater flow downhill between the saturated East Pit water level (1,592 feet AMSL) and the Peter Mitchell water level at closure (1,300 feet AMSL) and under long-term reclamation (1,500 feet AMSL). (Id., p. 4, Attachments autop. 13, 27) The volume of northward groundwater flow from the East Pit may be quite significant. GLIFWC’s preliminary modeling using the PolyMet MODFLOW model suggests that approximately 90% of the post-closure outflow from the NorthMet East Pit would migrate north due to the higher conductivity of the Virginia Formation and Biwabik Iron Formation and the lower elevations of the Peter Mitchell Pit at closure (1,300 feet) and over the long-term (1,500 feet) as compared to the Duluth Complex rock and Partridge River elevation (1,548 feet) on the south of the mine site. At closure, when the Peter Mitchell Pit is 1,300 feet deep, northward outflow is estimated at 300 gpm, stabilizing at 75 gpm in long-term closure. (GLIFWC letter to Co-Lead Agencies Discharge from PolyMet East Pit at Closure, Oct. 20, 2015, Exhibit 9).",WAT,S,O,8,"MDNR et al, 2014b; MDNR et al. 2015c"
Paula Maccabee,"GLIFWC also analyzed the potential that contaminants in the PolyMet NorthMet mine surficial aquifer would flow northward as a result of the increase in pit depth and future closure of the Peter Mitchell Pit. Given the proximity of the NorthMet Category 1 stockpile (0.8 miles) and East Pit (1.2 miles) to the Peter Mitchell Pit and the experience with other taconite pits where a cone of depression affecting surficial water can extend 1.4 to 1.5 miles from the pits, preliminary MODFLOW modeling showed northward flow of contaminants at the time of the Peter Mitchell Pit closure.

Paula Maccabee,"The response of Co-Lead Agencies to the potential for northward flow was memorialized in an Interagency Technical Memorandum on October 12, 2015. (FEIS reference MDNR et al. 2015c). This Memorandum suggested that the PolyMet MODFLOW model used by GLIFWC might need to be adjusted to accurately predict northward flow, but admitted that “the well data and the NorthMet Mine Site MODFLOW model do not exclude the possibility of a future northward bedrock flowpath from the proposed NorthMet pits to the Northshore pits.” (Id., pp.1- 2). Without assessing the reasonableness of a “leakage” assumption or the consequences for wetlands if it were to be valid, the Memorandum then hypothesized, “If this leakage rate is large enough, a bedrock groundwater mound would form between the two mines and prevent water from the proposed NorthMet pits from flowing northward to the Northshore pits.” (Id., p. 1) This theory is carried forward in the FEIS. (FEIS, 6-40 to 6-41).",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"GLIFWC’s analysis suggests that formation of a bedrock groundwater mound at the level necessary to prevent northward flow from the PolyMet NorthMet mine site as a result of the gradient to the expanded Peter Mitchell Pit is “hydrologically impossible.” (GLIFWC Northward Flowpath Letter, Exhibit 8, p. 5). In addition, if the Co-Leads’ theory were plausible and enough water could flow through the 100 Mile Swamp to create a large mound of water in bedrock, statements in PolyMet documents and in the FEIS that there is minimal connection between wetlands and groundwater north of the mine site would all be called into question. (GLIFWC email to MDNR et al. Bedrock-Wetland Connections at PolyMet Mine Site, July 29, 2015, Exhibit 10). The Co-Lead Agencies’ new “leakage” theory would suggest that secondary wetland impacts to the 100 Mile Swamp from NorthMet mine drawdown would be virtually certain and highly damaging.",WET,S,O,8,MDNR et al. 2015c Section 2
Paula Maccabee,"The Co-Lead Agencies’ theory that leakage from rain through the surficial aquifer to groundwater could prevent northward flow of PolyMet NorthMet contaminants may or may not be correct. What is clear to WaterLegacy is that the potential consequences of the northward flow of NorthMet pollution into the Boundary Waters watershed and the potential consequences of a large leakage rate and significant secondary impact on 100 Mile Swamp wetlands should have been provided in the FEIS, preferably with an assessment of which risk is more probable.",WET,S,N,8,MDNR et al. 2015c Section 3.2. FEIS Section 5.2.3.
Paula Maccabee,"The indefinite formulation in the Co-Lead Agencies’ Memorandum (MDNR et al. 2015c) and the FEIS (FEIS, 6-40 to 6-41) allows project proponents to have it both ways. When it is time to evaluate the adverse impacts of NorthMet mine drawdown on 100 Mile Swamp wetlands, it is claimed that there is little or no connection between wetlands and bedrock groundwater. Then, when it is time to evaluate the adverse impacts of PolyMet NorthMet pollution flowing north to the Boundary Waters, it is claimed that there is a robust connection, sufficient to form a huge underground mound of water preventing northward flow. Neither state nor federal laws allow this type of gamesmanship in environmental review.",WET,S,N,8,MDNR et al. 2015c. Section 1.2 pg. 5. FEIS Section 5.2.3.
Paula Maccabee,"The PolyMet NorthMet FEIS uses a singular approach to environmental review. Rather than analyzing adverse environmental effects and mitigation alternatives so the permitting authority can make a reasoned decision about whether to permit the project and, if is permitted, which mitigation measures to mandate in the permit, the FEIS declines to analyze environmental impacts and then provides a laundry list of mitigation options that may or may not be effective and may or may not come to pass. This FEIS strategy may be convenient for a project proponent, but it is contrary to state and federal environmental law.",ALT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS contains a long list of “contingency mitigation” measures that would not be financially assured or triggered by any set of findings, but might be “appropriate” should monitoring or “refined modeling” demonstrate that they are “needed.” (FEIS, 5-239). Several of these measures pertain to the likely performance failures of engineered systems, such as liners and seepage collection systems. As reflected in WaterLegacy’s SDEIS comments, PolyMet’s work plans for the mine site (FEIS ref. Barr 2012c) and plant site (FEIS ref. Barr 2012d) required that performance of engineered systems be modeled as an “uncertain” input. Rather than conduct an experiment with Minnesota’s environment, the FEIS should require upfront disclosure of risks.",ALT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 128
Paula Maccabee,"References in the FEIS to “refined” modeling and “contingency mitigation” in case water quality was “worse than expected” or as a result of “compliance issues” (FEIS, 5-239 to 5-240) should be setting off klaxons. Interception wells often ameliorate pollution at Superfund sites, but their potential future use should not justify creating a new contaminant source.",ALT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"The problematic nature of the “contingency mitigation” approach is underscored by the lack of evidence that mitigation options would be effective. It is suggested that if East Pit or West Pit fractures or faults create conduits to groundwater, use of grout “would be evaluated” to mitigate polluted seepage from pits. (FEIS, p. 5-239). However, the cited reference (FEIS ref. PolyMet 2014l) is only a “conceptual plan.” No data is cited to suggest that grout would effectively prevent seepage from a fractured mine pit for any extended period of time, let alone permanently. The “contingency mitigation” proposal for northward flow of NorthMet contaminants into the Boundary Waters watershed exemplifies the risks of this approach. Again, the FEIS proposes that grouting might be used to prevent northward flow even though “its effectiveness at the NorthMet site is uncertain.” (FEIS, 5-240). The next option on the list is lowering the water level in the East Pit and West Pit below the level (1,500 feet AMSL) of the Northshore Peter Mitchell Pit. (FEIS, 5-241). The FEIS notes that this option would “require a higher capacity water treatment facility and possibly additional treatment processes entailing additional expense.” (Id.) The FEIS does not mention that the East Pit and West Pit are both permanent sources of contamination or the fact that the GoldSim model upon which the FEIS relied to assume that oxidation would be minimal in the East Pit was based on a Geochemical Uncertainty Analysis stating that exposure of East Pit walls to air would increase sulfate levels by a factor of at least 823 times, with resulting increases in toxic metals leachate. (FEIS, p. A- 534 citation to Day, Geochemical Uncertainty Analysis, October 10, 2008, Exhibit 11).14 At best, lowering the water level in the East Pit is an improbable mitigation strategy; at worst, it is an additional untenable threat to water quality. The third item on the contingency mitigation list is a system of groundwater extraction wells, the number, geographic extent and configuration of which are unknown. In addition to being unproved, this option would involve building roads, laying water lines, electrical lines and access pads across the 100 Mile Swamp. (FEIS, 5-242). The final option suggested is to dig an infiltration trench between the mine pits and the Partridge River, construct an undetermined number of wells, water supply lines and roads, ensure recharge water is free of particulates to prevent clogging and artificially create a bedrock groundwater mound.

Although the reference cited (Barr 2015b) to suggest this option might work uses the word “mound,” it is an unrelated document pertaining to mounding beneath the tailings waste facility. The FEIS states, “The exact type, location, scale, and timing of mitigation measures are not known at this time.” (FEIS, 5-240). They may never be known, may never be feasible beyond a conceptual stage, and may never be constructed, particularly since they would not be financially assured.

Paula Maccabee,"WaterLegacy would also emphasize that monitoring does not prevent pollution of surface or groundwater. Minnesota has a long history of monitoring pollution from mining facilities, including those that have gone into bankruptcy, leaving a legacy of contamination. In order to prevent irreparable harm to wetlands and water quality, environmental risks of a proposed mining project must be rigorously analyzed, publicly disclosed and mitigated before a project is permitted.",PER,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"WaterLegacy believes the current FEIS is incomplete and unreliable in its characterization of the groundwater system at the mine site, in its description of the connection between surficial deposits and groundwater and in its characterization of the volume and direction of polluted seepage. We are concerned that the FEIS fails to evaluate environmental impacts, such as an increase in propagation of pollutants due to fractures, destruction or degradation of wetlands through mine dewatering, and northward groundwater flow of pollutant to the Boundary Waters watershed not because these impacts cannot be modeled, but because to do so could reveal significant environmental concerns. We have also found the MDNR’s changes in position regarding the appropriate level of mine site groundwater baseflow15 both troubling and confusing.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"Although characterization of groundwater seems like an arcane issue, we share GLIWFC’s perception that it is the key to understanding both the NorthMet project’s impacts on water quality and its impacts on wetlands. As John Coleman explained in GLIFWC’s recent letter to Co-Lead Agencies, Adequate characterization of the groundwater system at a proposed mine site is essential to understanding most of the potential impacts from the project. The amount of water entering the groundwater system, be it precipitation or discharge from the bed of lakes, rivers or mine pits, determines the direction of flow and dilution of contaminants, and dictates points of compliance for both ground and surface waters. The horizontal and vertical conductivity of the soil and bedrock materials determines how the groundwater system responds to stresses and the rate at which the groundwater flows horizontally and vertically. The character of interaction between surface water features and the groundwater system, whether it is loss of water from rivers or wetlands to the groundwater system, or discharge from the groundwater system to the surface water features, determines predicted impacts to surface water features by stresses such as mine dewatering.

Paula Maccabee,"With so much at stake, we believe it is incumbent upon responsible agencies to test a project proponent’s modeling and verify the proponent’s conclusions. According to GLIFWC’s Preliminary FEIS Comments, this has never been done: We have learned from the MNDNR project managers that ERM and lead agency staff never ran the mine site MODFLOW model during their technical review. In fact, only the applicant’s consultant (Barr Engineering) and Tribal staff have run the model and tested its functionality. It is surprising to discover that at no time during the eight years of project review have the lead agencies and/or their consultant tested how the model works. This fact leads to serious questions about the legitimacy of the conclusions reached by the ERM and lead agencies regarding the quality of the applicant’s model. (GLIFWC PFEIS Comments, Technical Review of the Mine Site MODFLOW Model, Exhibit 12). By this point in project review, when the Co- Lead Agencies have already vouched for the FEIS and the modeling done by PolyMet’s consultants, it is too late for these agencies to perform the role of independent review. WaterLegacy requests that the U.S. Geologic Survey or other undisputed and unbiased experts be retained to perform independent water modeling for the NorthMet project. The late timing of this review is certainly not ideal.

Paula Maccabee,"PolyMet NorthMet tailings would be deposited in a wet slurry on top of the existing unlined LTVSMC taconite tailings piles. (FEIS, pp. 4-427, 5-5, 5-185) The 4 1⁄2 mile square LTVSMC tailings waste facility was built above wetlands and three small streams to facilitate drainage of water through taconite tailings piles. The historical development of the tailings waste facility over wetlands and streams is shown in Exhibit 13. The NorthMet tailings waste facility would not be lined to contain seepage. (FEIS, 3-104, 3-158). NorthMet sulfide mine tailings slurry would be deposited immediately above LTVSMC tailings and slimes. (FEIS, Figure 5.2.14-6) The completed tailings height of the NorthMet waste cells would be 1,735 above sea level. (FEIS, 3-104). That is 60 feet higher than the highest feature to the east and more than 200 feet higher than gradient on the west, northwest, north and south sides of the tailings. (FEIS, Figure 4.2.2-17). Elevations above surrounding land create hydraulic pressure for seepage. The PolyMet NorthMet project would produce 110,736 tons of wet tailings slurry per day, of which liquids would be 68.5 percent by weight or 86 percent by volume. (FEIS ref. PolyMet 2015q, autop. 621). The seepage rate from slurry tailings is considerably higher than that of either past or thickened tailings. The Senior Director of Geotechnical Engineering and Hydrogeology for Newmont Mining Corporation has estimated the seepage rate from slurry tailings at 6.4 gallons per minute per acre, the seepage rate from paste or thickened tailings at 0.06 gallons per minute per acre and the seepage from dry filtered tailings at 0.007 gallons per acre.16 As compared to dry filtered tailings, slurry tailings produce approximately 914 times as much seepage. PolyMet’s wet slurry tailings waste facility is predicted to produce 3,880 gallons of tailings seepage per minute. (FEIS, 5-179, 5-181), equivalent to 2,041,000,000 gallons of contaminated seepage per year.17 PolyMet NorthMet tailings seepage would be collected from the toe of the tailings heaps and would contain sulfates and heavy metals from copper-nickel processing slurry, effluent from the mine site treatment plant, and LTVSMC tailings.

Since leaching depends on surface area, data from MinnAMAX copper-nickel tailings would provide more comparable field experience than data from waste rock piles used in FEIS modeling. (FEIS, 5-62). Such data was not used. Leachate from MinnAMAX copper-nickel tailings contained maximum levels of cobalt more than 30 times the tailings seepage concentration predicted for the NorthMet project, levels of nickel more than 21 times the predicted P90 NorthMet concentrations, and sulfate concentrations more than 11 times higher than predicted NorthMet concentrations.

Paula Maccabee,"Objections raised by geologist J.D. Lehr in his review of the SDEIS have not been addressed in the FEIS. Mr. Lehr objected to the “simplistic and cursory treatment of the role that bedrock fractures may play in the transmission of groundwater” at the tailings site. (Lehr, 2014, p. 3). He objected to the assumption of a “no-flow boundary” beneath the tailings piles and the resulting implication that groundwater flow through bedrock at the tailings site “is so insignificant that it can be ignored.” (Id.). He commented that the failure to identify fractures or assess groundwater flow through fractured bedrock “was a major omission, resulting in unsupported assumptions and inadequate information regarding groundwater flow” at the tailings waste site (Id., p. 4) and raised concerns that neither the project proponent nor the Co-Lead Agencies have required any study of bedrock fractures or their hydrogeologic properties. (Id., p. 15) Mr. Lehr objected to language in the SDEIS interjecting ambiguity by stating that faults have been “inferred but not confirmed.” He explained, “Essentially all aspects of geologic maps are inferred because they usually cannot be viewed or measured directly. This fault’s location [beneath the tailings site] is mapped based on sound geologic inference or it wouldn’t be shown.” He noted that faults can only be “confirmed” by excavation along their entire length. (Id., p. 14).",WAT,S,O,3,"SDEIS Theme WR 010. Bedrock Hydrology at the NorthMet Mine and Plants Site November 17, 2014"
Paula Maccabee,"Mr. Lehr also criticized the prior EIS for failing to include any hydraulic testing of bedrock in the tailings site area. (Id., p. 12, p. 15). He explained that analogies between Duluth Complex at the mine site and Giants Range Granite at the tailings site cannot be used to assume hydraulic conductivity of bedrock at the tailings site, since Giants Range Granite is 1,600 million years older than Duluth Complex and “would have experienced a different stress, weathering and erosional history than the Duluth Complex.” (Id., p. 15). Mr. Lehr emphasized that, to assess hydraulic conductivity, “What the SDEIS requires is data.” (Id., pp. 15-16). “Unless a solid scientific basis is provided, the SDEIS’ claims – both explicit and implicit – that groundwater flow through bedrock is minimal, cannot be sustained.” (Id., p. 16). Based on the scientific literature and his professional knowledge of the region’s geology, J.D. Lehr concluded, “bedrock fractures will play a significant role in groundwater and contaminant transport” at the tailings site.",WAT,S,O,8,Barr 2014b
Paula Maccabee,"Anthony Runkel, the Chief Geologist for the Minnesota Geological Survey, echoed these concerns, in an opinion on the SDEIS attached as Exhibit 14. Mr. Runkel stated that the investigations done for the NorthMet mine and tailings site “are not sufficient to recognize the hydrogeologic features known to be characteristic of other crystalline bedrock” on the Canadian Shield and not sufficient to support the modeling used for the project. He described techniques needed to investigate the Hydrogeologic conditions of fractured bedrock and explained: When these techniques have been used in generally similar hydrogeologic settings elsewhere on the Canadian Shield, the results support hydrogeologic conceptual models that differ substantially from those proposed for the Duluth Complex and Giants Range Batholith described in the SDEIS. Of particular significance for solute transport, the conceptual models commonly include key fractures or fracture zones of relatively high hydraulic conductivity, and multiple flow systems within the bedrock at individual sites. These flow systems are variably connected to the surface water system, have variable residence times, can have upward and downward vertical gradients within a local area, and horizontal flow directions that differ from one another. (Runkel, opinion on SDEIS, 2014, p.1, Exhibit 14) Mr. Runkel stated that use of a Duluth Complex analogy to assume that Giants Range Granite has a similar stress, weathering and erosional history “is not valid.” (Id., p. 2). He noted that faults are known to be common across much of mapped extent of the Giants Range Batholith, including in the plant site/tailings basin area. Mr. Runkel explained that nearby fractures in the same bedrock have had significant environmental effects, reporting, “Hydraulically significant fractures in the Giants Range Batholith are documented to have transported contaminants at the Northwoods Closed Landfill (MPCA reports) several miles north of the Plant Site/Tailings Basin area.”",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 012.

Paula Maccabee,The FEIS did not discuss these expert opinions or resolve their concerns.,MEPA,S,N,2,The Final EIS satisfies the requirement to provide responses to substantive comments on the Supplemental Draft EIS. Specifically: • Consideration of the no-flow boundary condition in the Plant Site modeling is addressed in Thematic Response 54. • Consideration of faults and fractures for groundwater flow is addressed in Thematic Response WR 012. • Consideration of assumed hydraulic conductivity of the Giants Range Granite relative to the Duluth Complex is addressed in Thematic Response WR 094.
Paula Maccabee,"Although fractures beneath the tailings site are mapped in an FEIS reference document (FEIS ref. Barr 2014b, Large Figures 1-2, Exhibit 3), the FEIS continues to minimize the significance of geologic evidence of fractures, stating “on published geologic maps, the faults in these areas are dashed and identified as conjectural with inferred (not exact) locations.” (FEIS, 4-445). The FEIS conceptual cross-section of the tailings basin groundwater containment system still characterizes the bedrock as an “assumed no flow boundary.” (FEIS, Figure 3.2-28). Responses to comments on the SDEIS state that the no- flow boundary has been changed at the “toe of the east embankment.” (FEIS, A-179, A-251, A-259, A-284, A-612). However this “change” is meaningless, since the FEIS assumes 100 percent collection of all seepage on the east side even without a no-flow assumption. (FEIS, 5-186). The FEIS also continues to use the mine site Duluth Complex bedrock for an analogy to assume hydraulic conductivity at bedrock depths in the Giants Range Granite beneath the tailings piles. (FEIS, 4-44). The FEIS contains no investigation of fractures beneath the tailings waste site. The FEIS estimates the hydraulic conductivity of the top 20 feet of bedrock around the plant site at 0.14 feet per day (FEIS, 4-113), but neither the FEIS nor the recent hydrogeology report prepared for PolyMet provide any information on hydraulic conductivity of tailings site bedrock beneath the top 20 feet. (See FEIS ref. Barr 2014b, pp. 21-22). Even the maps of geologic conditions identify only the top layers of schist beneath the existing LTVSMC tailings site.

Paula Maccabee,"In addition to explaining EIS inadequacies in modeling transmission of pollutants through groundwater at the tailings site, J.D.

Paula Maccabee,"On first reading of the FEIS, it might seem that the document addressed comments of WaterLegacy and J.D. Lehr’s opinion regarding seepage, since both south side and east side tailings seepage are now discussed. That impression would be mistaken. The FEIS mentions seepage on the east side of the tailings piles only long enough to assert that seepage containment “would be expected to capture 100 percent of tailings surface seepage and groundwater seepage.” (FEIS, 5-8). Similarly, on the south side, the FEIS simply asserts, “an existing seepage containment system would be upgraded by PolyMet to achieve 100 percent capture of tailings surface and groundwater seepage that otherwise would flow into Second Creek, a tributary of the Partridge River.” (FEIS, 5-102). The Change Definition Form documenting the direction given by the Co-Lead Agencies on modeling changes resulting from east pit seepage is instructive. The form states, “The capture efficiency of the East Side Seepage Containment System is assumed to be 100% (i.e., all water that reports to the East Containment System both surface and/or groundwater, is captured).” Thus, modeling can reflect 100% collection and 0% flow toward Mud Lake and no “eastern” flowpath need be added to the project description. (NorthMet Project CDF 251, East Dam GoldSim Modeling Changes, Sept. 12, 2014, Exhibit 15). Based on the information provided by PolyMet in its Water Modeling Data Package (FEIS ref. PolyMet 2015j) the FEIS claims that, during mine operations, 3,860 gallons per minute of the total 3,880 gpm modeled would be collected. (FEIS, 5-181, Table 5.2.2-37). This would be a nearly perfect collection rate of 99.5%. The FEIS and underlying PolyMet documents characterize all but 200 gpm (0.5%) of NorthMet tailings seepage as “surface seepage,” since that is the volume that currently seeps out of groundwater at the toe of the existing LTVSMC basin. (FEIS, 5-179, PolyMet 2015j). No analysis is done to determine if the increased volume and hydraulic head created in the tailings piles during NorthMet operations would result in more water being retained further into groundwater than under existing conditions. As Dr. Lee noted in his opinion regarding tailings basin performance, given the lack of data on bedrock groundwater, it is an open question how much groundwater is actually flowing in bedrock.

Paula Maccabee,"PolyMet’s underlying analysis (PolyMet 2015j) and the FEIS do not evaluate a range of tailings seepage collection performance or the effects of that performance on environmental quality; “for purposes of impact evaluation they are assumed to capture: 100 percent of the Tailings Basin’s surface seepage; 100 percent of the groundwater approaching the containment system from the Tailings Basin’s east and south toes; and 90 percent of the groundwater approaching the containment systems from the Tailings Basin’s north, northwest and west toes.” (FEIS, p. 5-186).",WAT,S,O,8,Barr 2015b
Paula Maccabee,"The claims of capture efficiency on the northwest, north and east sides made in the FEIS are based on PolyMet’s assumptions and models: “The capture efficiencies in water quality modeling were provided by the PolyMet (Barr 2015e, as cited in the FEIS).” (FEIS, A-583). “[T]he assumed capture efficiencies of the groundwater containment systems are justified and supported by modeling.” (FEIS, A-578, A-612). “Performance modeling of the north and northwest flowpaths has indicated that the proposed systems would provide greater than 90 percent capture of surficial aquifer and bedrock groundwater to 100 ft below the top of bedrock. Containment systems are assumed to capture 100 percent of tailings surface seepage.” (FEIS, 5-77). On the south side of the tailings piles, the FEIS’ claims of 100 percent tailings seepage collection are based on a promise by PolyMet. Since 2011, the current owner, Cliffs Erie, LLC has installed a seepage collection system on the south side of the existing LTVSMC tailings waste facility at surface discharge location SD026. This system includes a cutoff berm and trench, seep collection sump, pump and pipe system. (PolyMet 2015i). Although neither the FEIS nor PolyMet documents specify what percentage of south tailings seepage is currently collected by Cliffs Erie, water is bypassing the cutoff dam, and improvements in collection would be required to comply with the Cliffs consent decree. “It is acknowledged that there is currently incomplete capture of impacted water at SD026.” (FEIS, A-625). Claims in the FEIS that the proposed NorthMet project will result 100 percent seepage capture on the south side of the tailings piles are based on a vague but repeated promise that unspecified future upgrades will achieve perfect collection: “PolyMet has committed to future upgrades to achieve 100 percent capture by this system if the NorthMet Project Proposed Action is approved.” (FEIS, 3-120, A-84, A-195, A-197, A-616, 3-120). Although several possible changes in the dam on the south side are listed, no evidence is provided that any of them would be effective in capturing all seepage that comes to the surface on the south side of the tailings piles. (FEIS, 3-120, 5-102). No discussion in the FEIS proposes to identify or collect contaminated groundwater seepage on the south side of the tailings site. Even though no investigation has been done of bedrock groundwater at the tailings waste site, the FEIS assumes, “groundwater migration is not expected to the east or south.” (FEIS, 5-77) Dr. Lee reviewed the FEIS conclusions on tailings basin performance and concluded, “The analytical support for these conclusions is based on assumptions of performance that are not justified or supported by data.” (Lee, tailings opinion, 2015, p. 1). Dr. Lee’s concerns included the failure to verify modeling to show that the predictions of groundwater movement were representative of the tailings basin site (Id., p. 3) and the fact that the plant site model did not include bedrock or consistently describe groundwater flow in and around the tailings basin.

Paula Maccabee,"In responses to comments, the Co-Lead Agencies explained, “The design basis for the containment system is . . .to reverse the pre-existing hydraulic gradient (and flow direction) across the facility.” (FEIS, p. A-547). They also acknowledged, “Relatively few capture systems have been built with this degree of pumping to cause a reversal of the pre-existing hydraulic gradients.” (FEIS, p. A-548). WaterLegacy’s research has disclosed no similar systems operating long-term to reverse hydraulic gradient.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"Field experience and local geological conditions do not support claims made in the FEIS that a bentonite slurry trench would serve as an impermeable “cut-off wall” (FEIS, p. 5-197), or that it could be “keyed into” the tailings site bedrock. (FEIS, p. 5- 185). J.D. Lehr explained in his comments on the SDEIS that the granite bedrock at the tailings site would not be favorable to allow a keyed in trench. Large boulders and cobbles known to exist at the site would also impede construction of an effective slurry trench. (Lehr, 2014, pp. 17-18). Dr. Lee noted that the proposed slurry wall at a depth exceeding 40 feet in some locations was a significant undertaking, and that claims that a slurry wall would be nearly impermeable for the indefinite future were not justified. (Lee, tailings opinion, 2015, p. 3). These concerns are similar to those raised by Barr Engineering in a 2007 evaluation report of Tailings Basin Modifications to Eliminate Water Release via Seepage. (FEIS ref. Barr 2007f). The Barr 2007f report noted that variability in ground surface elevation would complicate construction, and both open trench construction and the “low strength of slurry walls” could also affect long-term embankment stability. Further, a slurry wall was “not suitable if boulders or cobbles are present.” (Id., p. 21).",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 019. FEIS Figure 5.2.2-14; Barr 2007f
Paula Maccabee,"WaterLegacy’s SDEIS comments reflected our efforts to find field experience verifying the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed seepage containment and pump-back system. FEIS reference CDs include a 2012 Barr Engineering memo for PolyMet citing the common use of slurry walls and collection trenches for water quality management. (FEIS ref. PolyMet 2015h, Attach. D, Groundwater Containment System: Degree of Use in Industry). This memo cites several examples of allegedly successful containment facilities. No information was found for any of these examples suggesting that the capture efficiency claimed for the PolyMet NorthMet tailings seepage collection system was achieved in practice. Barr’s memo highlighted the Fort McMurray tailings pond seepage containment system in Alberta Canada as an example of the successful use of slurry walls to isolate mine tailings seepage from downgradient water: Another example is the installation of a soil- bentonite cutoff wall around the perimeter of a mine tailings pond located in the province of Alberta, Canada. The cutoff wall is approximately 100-feet deep and 3 feet wide, and has a hydraulic conductivity of less than 1x10-7 cm/sec. The cutoff wall was used to isolate the tailings pond from downgradient surface water features including wetlands and the Athabasca River. (Id., pp. 1-2). However, information available since 2012 demonstrates that the Fort McMurray tar sands tailings seepage containment has been a serious failure. Canadian federal research using chemical profiling to confirm the contaminant source in the Athabasca River has shown that toxic chemicals from McMurray Formation oil sand tailings ponds are leaching into groundwater and seeping into the Athabasca River, despite ditches, cutoff walls, groundwater interception wells and a system where captured water is pumped back into tailings ponds. One dam has been reported to seep wastewater at a rate of 75 liters per second (625,200,000 U.S. gallons per year) into groundwater feeding the Athabasca River.20 Industry is working to address the tailings seepage issue, budgeting more than $1-billion in tailings-reduction technology. WaterLegacy is unaware of any data on capture of unlined tailings waste seepage that would support PolyMet’s modeling assumptions. In Minnesota, MPCA concluded in 2008 that the maximum estimated percentage of seepage to the Sandy River that could be collected from the unlined Minntac tailings waste facility was approximately 55 to 60 percent.22 In 2013, U.S. Steel confirmed that the dike and pump back system on the east side of the Minntac facility was collecting roughly 50 percent of the total seepage volume.23 After extensive research, the highest rate of seepage capture identified for any unlined facility using slurry walls appears to have been at the Hill Air Force Base in northern Utah, where a combination of the slurry walls, landfill covers, groundwater interception and extraction wells, and treatment succeeded in reducing metals concentrations from a Superfund site by 80 percent. In the EPA’s recent Pebble Mine assessment, the Agency recently concluded, “Water collection and treatment failures are a common feature of mines.” EPA stated that the probability of potential failure of water collection and treatment during operations is 93 percent, and results include “exceedance of standards potentially including death of fish and invertebrates.” Post-closure probability of failure of water collection and treatment was “somewhat higher than operation,” and “failures are likely to result in release of untreated or incompletely treated leachates for days or months. If the site were to be abandoned, EPA noted that failure of water collection and treatment was “certain.”",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 020

Paula Maccabee,"As with the potential mine site contamination discussed previously, the FEIS proposes a combination of monitoring and “contingency mitigation.” It is suggested that we wait and assess fractures “that could function as high-permeability conduits for groundwater” or “lead to violation of water quality standards” by monitoring once the PolyMet NorthMet project is in place and contaminated seepage is detected. At that point, unspecified “contingency mitigation measures would be employed to mitigate the fracture-related effects.” (FEIS, 5-37).",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS identifies several likely failures of the proposed tailings seepage collection system: new surface seepage locations may emerge as the tailings basin is developed; tailings pond water quality may be worse than expected; and groundwater or surface water downgradient of the tailings basin may fail to comply with water quality standards.

Paula Maccabee,"WaterLegacy’s comments on the SDEIS reflected our concern that the hydrometallurgical residue facility (HRF) would contain some of the most concentrated and toxic wastes produced by the PolyMet NorthMet project.

(FEIS, 5-609).",WAT,S,O,8,PolyMet 2014a of FEIS App A; RS33/RS65
Paula Maccabee,"Once the HRF pond becomes full and during reclamation, water from the HRF pond and drainage from the residue would be removed and treated at the plant site WWTP. (FEIS, 3-134). However, the modeled WWTP influent water quality during project reclamation does not reflect any of the expected concentrations from HRF contaminated wastewater. (FEIS ref. PolyMet 2015j, pp. 274-275). The FEIS continues to assume that leakage from the HRF into underlying groundwater or adjacent surface water “would be negligible” due to the double liner proposed and does not evaluate any potential environmental impacts from HRF waste facility seepage. (FEIS, 5-179). The PolyMet plant site Water Modeling Data Package explains, “The double liner system designed for the HRF is impermeable enough so that its effect on the environment can be ignored.” (PolyMet 2015j, p. 117).",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"The Data Package assumes a leakage rate of 2 defects per acre in the upper layer and that defects are circular with a diameter of 1 centimeter and that no defects will occur in the lower liner. (Id.) However data in PolyMet’s own Residue Management Plan suggests that 40% of installed liners have a defect density from 4 to 10 per acre and 10% a defect density from 10 to 20 per acre. (FEIS ref. PolyMet 2014r, p. 11). Although the hydraulic head between the upper and lower liner may be low, leakage could still occur.",WAT,S,O,8,"PolyMet 2014r Table 2-3, Section 2.2.4 and Attachment H; ""Good"" quality installation represents 1-4 defects/acre. This range is what PolyMet used due to installation methods"
Paula Maccabee,"Neither the FEIS nor the Residue Management Plan address the difference between the HRF proposal and modern landfill siting and performance. Modern landfills, on which the optimistic expectations of HRF leakage performance are based, cannot be sited on locations like the one proposed in the PolyMet NorthMet FEIS. As summarized on the EPA’s website, municipal solid waste landfills must comply with the federal regulations in 40 C.F.R. § 258 (Subtitle D of RCRA), or equivalent state regulations. Federal standards for solid waste landfills include: “Location restrictions—ensure that landfills are built in suitable geological areas away from faults, wetlands, flood plains, or other restricted areas.”27 Minnesota law similarly precludes the siting of either a hazardous or a solid waste facility in a wetland or in a location where the topography, geology, hydrology or soil is unsuitable for the protection of the ground water and the surface water. Minn. R. 7045.0460, Subp. 2, Minn. R. 7035.1600. The FEIS and supporting documents demonstrate that the proposed HRF is an unsuitable location for either a hazardous or an industrial waste landfill. The HRF would be located on approximately 36.1 acres of wetlands, 7.5 acres of which would be newly impacted by fill and are subject to both state and federal regulations. (FEIS, 5- 321). In addition to the wetlands, the HRF would be located on top of as much as 50 feet of fine tailings and slimes in the existing LTVSMC Emergency Basin. (FEIS, 5-664, Fig. 5.2.14-9). Although the FEIS proposes that a preload could be placed on these materials to compress them in order to reduce stress deformation and strain on the liner system, it is expected that the material would rebound a small amount after the preload is removed. (FEIS, 5-667). Differential settlement of foundation materials is known to create longitudinal strain for liner materials. (FEIS, 5-661).",PER,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme GT 11
Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS now recognizes that Minnesota Geological Survey maps show the existence of a fault directly beneath the proposed HRF location. (FEIS, 4-435, Barr 2014b Large Figures 1 and 2, Exhibit 3). The FEIS has identified yet another risk to liner deformation and integrity. Seeps along the southern edge of the existing LTVSMC tailings basin Cell 2W have been observed with the potential to create phreatic build-up below the HRF liners. The HRF would require a collection drain beneath the proposed embankment and liner systems to transmit the collected seep to the exterior of the HRF facility and reduce this risk. (FEIS, 5-662 to 5-663).",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"Concerns about potential failure of containment related to the hydrometallurgical residue facility are discussed in Section IX, infra, along with other risks of failure not assessed by the FEIS. The FEIS remains inadequate both due to its inappropriate secrecy regarding the nature and concentration of hydrometallurgical residue facility contaminants and because it has assumed a level of liner integrity that is inconsistent with the unsuitable location selected for disposal of PolyMet’s hydrometallurgical wastes.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,WaterLegacy’s comments on the SDEIS discussed both the unacceptable adverse impacts of the PolyMet NorthMet project on wetlands and the inadequate mitigation proposed by PolyMet for adverse wetland impacts. WaterLegacy’s substantive arguments that the project’s wetlands impacts and improper mitigation do not allow issuance of a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit are presented in separate comments on the permit.,WET,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"Comments below reflect our concern that the FEIS does not analyze the adverse environmental effects of the proponent’s mitigation plan, but instead argues on behalf of this plan. This advocacy is contrary to the requirements of environmental review.",NEPA,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"We then focus on the inadequacy of the FEIS’ assessment of the NorthMet project’s indirect effects on wetlands. At the end of Section II, supra, discussing project mine site impacts, WaterLegacy requested independent water modeling. Such independent water modeling could be used to quantify indirect impacts on wetlands. In the alternative, since it is the only quantification of wetlands drawdown impacts in this record, the Co-Lead Agencies should accept GLIFWC’s analysis of mine site impacts to wetlands for purposes of alternatives analysis, wetlands mitigation and permitting.",PER,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"Rather than assessing the adverse impacts on wetlands acreage and function in the St. Louis River watershed and the Lake Superior Basin resulting from the proponent’s failure to provide in-watershed and in-kind compensatory mitigation, the FEIS attempts to justify the mitigation proposal by claiming that PolyMet selected most of its mitigation before the Federal Mitigation Rule was finalized. (FEIS, 5-363). This argument is substantively invalid, as explained in the expert opinion of Morgan Robertson (Robertson, 2015, pp. 11-13) and in WaterLegacy’s comments regarding the Section 404 permit application. In addition, by advocating for some type of exemption from federal mitigation rules, rather than explaining the adverse effects of operating outside the rules, the FEIS adopts a role of justifying, rather than analyzing the proposed mitigation. This advocacy is inconsistent with NEPA regulations. 40 C.F.R. §1502.2(g).",WET,S,N,8,"The USACE will determine the suitability of proposed compensatory mitigation for project-related direct and indirect wetland impacts. For the State, project- related physical alteration of wetlands requires compensatory mitigation to be sufficient to ensure replacement of the diminished or lost designated uses (of the impacted wetlands) under Minnesota Rules, part 7050.0186. The Final EIS identifies to the extent prudent and feasible, the same types of wetlands are to be replaced in the same watershed, before or concurrent with the actual alteration of the wetland. In addition, the state Wetlands Conservation Act states that for wetlands in counties where 80 percent or more of pre-settlement wetlands exist, including St. Louis County where the project is proposed, minimum replacement ratio requirements are determined by mitigation location and type. Section 3.3.3 of the Final SDD requires the EIS to ""describe and discuss the suitability and feasibility of various wetland mitigation strategies. This aspect of the EIS scope is accomplished in Final EIS Section 5.2.3.3.2. Final determinations on the proposed mitigation satisfying in-watershed and in- kind compensation will occur in permitting."
Paula Maccabee,"Under both state and federal law, an EIS must analyze the significant environmental impacts of a proposed action. Minn. Stat.§116D.04, Subd. 2a; 40 C.F.R.§1502.1. Under both regulatory regimes, an EIS must provide a thorough analysis of both direct and indirect potential adverse effects. Minn. R. 4410.2300(H); 40 C.F.R. §1502.16(a)(b). In most cases, the Clean Water Act Section 404 process relies on final EIS for the evaluation of the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative (LEDPA) and related factual findings of compliance or noncompliance with restrictions on discharge. 40 C.F.R. §§ 230.10(a)(4), 230.12. Secondary effects on aquatic systems and on wetlands must be determined in order to assess whether a project may be permitted. 40 C.F.R. §§ 230.11, 230.41(b). There is no dispute that indirect effects of the NorthMet project are significant, no matter what scale of comparison is provided. The FEIS acknowledges that the proposed sulfide mine project could indirectly affect up to 7,694.2 acres of wetlands located within and around project sites. (FEIS, 5-251). This potential indirect wetland impact is more than eight times the 913.8-acre (FEIS, ES-36) direct impact of the project on wetlands. Taken together, potential impacts of the NorthMet project on wetlands in the Partridge and Embarrass River watersheds affect up to 8,608 acres, equivalent to 13 percent of the 65,567 remaining acres of wetlands in the two watersheds combined. (FEIS, 6-57, Table 6.2.3-3).28 The FEIS acknowledges that indirect effects on wetlands would result from wetland fragmentation; alteration of wetland hydrology resulting from changes in watershed area, groundwater drawdown, seepage containment at the tailings facility and changes in stream flow at the mine and plant site; and water quality changes related to deposition of dust, ore spillage and leakage and seepage and leakage from mine pits, waste rock storage and other mine features. (FEIS, 5-319, 5-347) The PolyMet NorthMet mine site and potentially impacted proximate wetlands are within the 100 Mile Swamp and the Upper Partridge River site. (FEIS, 4-481, A-509; WaterLegacy SDEIS comments, Exhibit 30). Approximately 92 percent of the wetlands within the mine site are high quality. (FEIS, 4-196) Wetlands that would be directly and indirectly impacted by the NorthMet mine site are sites of high biological diversity, based on high quality peatlands in the 100 Mile Swamp and Partridge River Peatlands sites and on the numerous rare species in the Upper Partridge River site. (WaterLegacy SDEIS comments, Exhibit 30). The EPA’s comments on the PolyMet NorthMet SDEIS emphasized the need to quantitatively assess indirect wetlands of the tailings basin and mine site project: Comment# 17. The SDEIS describes current site conditions, including the acreage, type, and quality of the wetland resources at the tailings basin and mine sites. The SDEIS also describes the proposed direct impacts remaining after measures to avoid or minimize direct impacts. However, the SDEIS does not quantitatively assess indirect impacts or measures to minimize and mitigate these impacts, except with respect to wetland losses due to fragmentation. The SDEIS also omits all indirect impacts from the cumulative impacts analysis for wetlands (Section 6.2.3.4).",WET,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"Recommendation: The FEIS should quantitatively assess all indirect impacts. The FEIS should more clearly describe the proposed mitigation plan, including mitigation for indirect impacts. (U.S.EPA, Comments on PolyMet NorthMet SDEIS, Exhibit 1) The FEIS does not follow this recommendation and does not quantify indirect wetlands impacts. The FEIS states, “The indirect effects analyses performed for the EIS were not performed to characterize impacts but were done to inform where monitoring should take place for those areas that were identified as having a potential for indirect wetland effects.” (FEIS, 5- 259). This phrase is not an oversight, since it was repeated in the FEIS and in responses to comments at least 14 times (FEIS, 5-342, 5-348, A-25, A-37, A-39, A-116, A-225, A-294, A- 342, A-481, A-482, A-496, A-504, A-623), along with the admonishment that “the identification of specific mitigation for indirect effects . . is not a requirement for an EIS. (FEIS, A- 116, A- 295, A-343, A-481, A-482). By its own language, the FEIS has failed to comply with the basic requirements of NEPA and MEPA, has failed to provide the foundation for a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit and has rejected the recommendation of the EPA to quantify indirect impacts on wetlands and describe a clearer plan for their mitigation.",WET,S,O,8,"Response to EPA Comment #2997.

Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS asserts that the information needed to evaluate indirect wetland effects is unavailable, paraphrasing applicable state and federal law. (FEIS, 5-260). However, at no point in this record do the Co-Lead Agencies allege any factual basis to support this assertion. Both Minnesota law and federal law limit the situations in which a responsible agency can claim information needed for environmental assessment is “unavailable.” Under Minnesota rules, if information about potentially significant environmental effects is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives, information is unavailable only if the “cost of obtaining it is excessive” or “the means to obtain the information are beyond the state of the art.” Minn. R. 4410.2500; Mid States Coalition for Progress v. Surface Transp. Bd., 345 F.3d 520, 549-550 (8th Cir. 2003) Under federal regulations, if information is relevant to reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts, it is only considered to be unavailable if “overall costs of obtaining it are exorbitant or the means to obtain it are not known.” 40 C.F.R.§1502.22(b). Absent these findings, detailed quantitative assessments of possible mitigation measures are necessary when a federal agency prepares an EIS to assess the impacts of a relatively contained, site-specific proposal. See Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain v. U.S. Forest Service, 137 F. 3d 1372, 1380-81 (9th Cir. 1988); The Wilderness Soc’y v. Bosworth, 118 F. Supp. 2d 1082, 1106-07 (D. Mont. 2000). The FEIS makes no claim that modeling to predict wetlands drawdown would be exorbitant, excessively costly, beyond the state of the art or that the means to obtain this information are not known. The FEIS merely states a preference for using the analog method to evaluate wetlands drawdown: The Co-lead Agencies have thoroughly considered throughout the development of the EIS and through the Wetland IAP Working Group how to assess potential indirect wetland effects. As a result, strengths and weaknesses of the approach used, as well as other suggested approaches, have been carefully considered. The Co-lead Agencies ultimately decided that the use of the analog method and the 20 percent change in watershed area metric described in this section as factors considered in identifying potential indirect effects to wetlands is a credible and reasonable approach consistent with the requirements of NEPA. (FEIS, 5-260) The FEIS also stated, citing the PolyMet Wetland Data Package, that analog data were used instead of a model such as MODFLOW because MODFLOW “could not practicably be used to estimate potential indirect wetland effects, due to complex mixes of bedrock, surficial deposits, and wetland soils at the Mine Site” and since “It is challenging to accurately represent this complex hydrology through modeling.” (FEIS, 5-257, 5-263, citing PolyMet 2015b). Acknowledging the availability of other modeling tools in responses to comments, the Co-Lead Agencies explained, “A hydrological study, pump test, and/or laser test was not performed as the Co-lead Agencies utilized the analog approach for assessing potential groundwater drawdown.” (FEIS, A-489 to A-499). The preference for the analog approach, even if it is reasonable, does not meet the requirements for “unavailable” information under either NEPA or Minnesota’s comparable MEPA rules. In his comment on the PolyMet NorthMet SDEIS, wetlands expert Brian Branfireun opined that reliance on an analog case to evaluate the potential extent and magnitude of the cone of depression and dewatering impact of surface wetlands and streams is unsatisfactory, “given the availability of robust hydrogeological models that could reasonably evaluate potential impact scenarios.” (Branfireun, 2014, p. 14). Hydrologist Donald Lee stated both that an analog approach would need to be validated, which hadn’t been done in the SDEIS and that “MODFLOW has the capability to calculate the effects of pit dewatering providing the appropriate input is incorporated into the model.” Dr. Lee also pointed out that selectively rejecting MODFLOW for the purpose of wetlands assessment called into question the legitimacy of all other EIS analysis of hydrology and water quality. (Lee, 2014, p. 12) Since the SDEIS, MODFLOW has been used to update the precise predictions most relevant to the assessment of the nature and cone of depression. As described in more detail in Section II, supra, discussing mine site modeling, PolyMet recently updated its assessment of the hydraulic conductivity of wetland deposits and of Virginia Formation bedrock (FEIS, 5-19. 5-29, Table 5.2.2-7) and revised its estimates of groundwater inflow to the west and east mine pits. (FEIS, 5-111, Table 5.2.2-19)",WET,S,N,8,"Section 3.3.3 of the Final SDD did not require modeling for the assessment of wetland impacts. The scope only identified that wetland impacts associated with the entire project would be identified and discussed in the EIS. The DNR considered the possibility of using the EIS’s groundwater flow model, which was required under Final SDD Section 6.2 to predict groundwater inflows to the mine pits, for assessing potential indirect wetland impacts that might occur due to drawdown effects from pit dewatering. Ultimately, it was determined that the MODFLOW model could not reliably model the complex mix of fractured bedrock, glacial till, and wetland soils in the project area. Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2300, subpart H, states that data and analyses (in the EIS) must be commensurate with the importance of the impact and the relevance of the information to a reasoned choice among alternatives and to the need for mitigation measures. DNR asserts that the analog method used to assess potential indirect wetland impacts is consistent with the rule and requirements of the Final SDD."
Paula Maccabee,"The Co-lead Agencies also recently used MODFLOW to predict the number of inches of downward leakage through wetlands necessary to prevent northward flow as a result of the downhill hydraulic gradient of the Northshore Mine Peter Mitchell Pit.

Paula Maccabee,"However, this record does contain a quantitative assessment of wetlands drawdown impacts using the Co-Leads’ preferred analog approach. An Analysis of Indirect Wetland Impacts from Groundwater Drawdown using a calibrated analog approach was provided by GLIFWC prior to the preparation of the SDEIS in November 2013 and is included in Appendix C of the FEIS. (FEIS, App. C, autop. 2985-3025). Neither the SDEIS nor the FEIS challenged the methodology or conclusions of this analysis, even in responding to Major Difference of Opinion with Tribal Cooperating Agencies. (see e.g. FEIS, 8-13 to 8-14). Calibrating the analog method to other pits on the Iron Range, using the three zones of proximity to mine pits, and specifying the level of drawdown, acreage and types of wetlands that would be affected, GLIFWC concluded that wetlands likely to be severely impacted by dewatering totaled 3,188.62 acres in Zone 1 (0 to 1,000 feet), 2,458.12 acres in Zone 2 (1,000 – 2,000 feet) and 273.01 acres in Zone 3 (2,000 – 5,000 feet). Severe indirect impacts to wetlands from mine pit drawdown would total 5,719.75 acres. (FEIS, App. C, autop. 2994). This calibrated analog model provides available and uncontroverted quantification of indirect impacts on wetlands from mine dewatering.",WET,S,O,8,FEIS pg. 8-13
Paula Maccabee,"As with other changes in language since the SDEIS discussed in preceding Sections of our comments, there are several places where the FEIS appears to recognize the potential indirect impacts on wetlands, only to mischaracterize references and reject findings that those impacts are likely to occur. The FEIS states it “has been updated to make a more conservative assumption of the potential indirect effects for all bog communities within the zero to 1,000-ft analog zone.” (FEIS, 5-253) The FEIS admits that “although the hydrology of ombrotrophic bogs is solely precipitation-driven, these wetlands can have flowpath connections to groundwater.” (FEIS, 4- 168, citing Eggers 2015). However, the way in which the FEIS makes this update is to classify both ombrotrophic and minerotrophic bogs as having a “low likelihood” of being affected by groundwater drawdowns associated with proposed mining operations, (FEIS, 5-273) and to state that ombrotrophic bogs have a low susceptibility to effects from groundwater drawdown (FEIS, 4- 169) and a low degree of effect from groundwater drawdown associated with mining. (FEIS, 4- 169). For each of these conclusions on each of these pages the FEIS references a January 15, 2015 memorandum of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) staff member Steve Eggers. (Eggers 2015). As Dr. Branfireun explains in his recent opinion on the PolyMet NorthMet FEIS, these statements mischaracterize the professional conclusions reached by Eggers (2015). (Branfireun, 2015, pp. 15-16). Eggers’ memorandum doesn’t minimize the likelihood of hydrology impacts on either ombrotrophic bogs or minerotrophic bogs. Eggers states, that although some reviewers would focus on whether the designation of “low likelihood” is accurate or “moderate likelihood” or “high likelihood” is a better designation, “The bottom line is that the potential for indirect impacts to all bog communities within the 0-1,000 foot analog zone is acknowledged.” (Eggers 2015, p. 4). Eggers’ reason for this recognition is simple, “Ombrotrophic bogs, although precipitation-driven, can have flowpath connections with groundwater; therefore, these wetlands could be impacted by groundwater drawdown.” (Id., p. 5). Thus, Eggers recommends, as a conservative approach responsive to public comments, that all bogs within the 0-1,000 foot analog zone be assigned to the same category for likelihood of hydrology effects “to acknowledge a potential for adverse impacts.” (Id., p. 5).",WET,S,N,8,"Section 3.3.3 of the Final SDD requires the EIS to ""describe and discuss the suitability and feasibility of various wetland mitigation strategies. This aspect of the EIS scope is accomplished in Final EIS Section 5.2.3.3.2. Final determinations on the proposed mitigation satisfying in-watershed and in-kind compensation will occur in permitting."
Paula Maccabee,"Since the FEIS does not quantify any impacts of mine drawdown on any wetlands, the primary result of any new classification of ombrotrophic bogs would be related to the monitoring proposed in the FEIS. The formulation of how monitoring and mitigation might take place is unclear. In some places it is suggested that if monitoring showed indirect wetland effects had occurred “adaptive management practices to reduce wetland effects would be considered” and additional compensation “may be required.” (FEIS, 5-361). Other sections of the FEIS suggest that the agencies would be relying on potential analog impact zones to determine monitoring, but in the event that wetland monitoring identified “additional” indirect effects (additional to what is not specified) “permit conditions would likely include a plan for adaptive management practices to be implemented.” (FEIS, 5-254). Plans for monitoring, mitigation or adaptive management seem vague, but the degree to which this loose formulation fails to protect dewatered mine site wetlands becomes more clear once other indirect wetlands impacts are reviewed.",WET,S,O,8,FEIS pg. 5-262
Paula Maccabee,"As noted above, the FEIS text seems to recognize that there are potential impacts on wetland hydrology as a result of groundwater seepage containment at the tailings site. (FEIS, 5- 347). Given the high volume of tailings seepage proposed to be collected (Section III, supra) and the fact that there are 2,754.8 acres of wetlands abutting Mud Lake, Trimble and Unnamed Creek at the tailings facility (FEIS, 5-335, Table 5.2.3-11), one might think there would be a rigorous analysis of indirect impacts of changes on wetlands from capturing seepage. The FEIS first states that, despite augmentation, the response of complex natural systems can only be estimated. (FEIS, 5-334) Then, citing PolyMet 2015b, the FEIS concludes that due to stream augmentation within 20 percent of existing flows, no potential indirect wetland effects would be identified or anticipated for any of the wetlands abutting Second Creek, Mud Lake Creek, Trimble Creek or Unnamed Creek. (FEIS, 5-334, 5-335).",WET,S,O,8,FEIS Section 5.2.3.2.4
Paula Maccabee,"Mine site water quality impacts on wetlands are also discussed in the FEIS only to be summarily dismissed. The FEIS discloses that there are 515.9 acres of wetlands within mine site groundwater flowpaths, 351.2 acres of which are designated minerotrophic (FEIS, 5-320, Table 5.2.3-7). The FEIS states that it was assumed that all downgradient minerotrophic wetlands located within the five mine site surficial aquifer flowpaths “may have potential indirect wetland effects related to water quality changes as a result off leakage/seepage from mine features.” (FEIS, 5-313, 5-319). However, by now unsurprisingly, the impact of reasonably foreseeable mine site leakage/seepage on wetlands is not modeled or assessed in the FEIS. The FEIS explains that PolyMet’s water quality model “assumed that the leakage/seepage from mine features releases directly to the Partridge River; therefore, it is assumed that groundwater would not emerge in surface water or wetlands along intermediate portions of the flowpaths (PolyMet 2015m).” (FEIS, 5-320, emphasis added). The FEIS does not propose a new or better model. It advises, “The water quality model cannot be used to quantify the amount of leakage/seepage from mine features that discharge directly to individual wetlands” (Id.), and more generally, “The leakage/seepage analysis could not indicate or suggest that an effect or adverse effect would occur on wetlands.” (Id.) In the same text emphasizing that no water modeling would assess or mitigate an actual adverse effect, the FEIS insists that this approach was “conservative” because it had identified a potential effect. (Id.) The only consequence of this elaborate discussion: wetlands with potential effects would be “identified for consideration in the proposed wetland monitoring plan.” (FEIS, 5-319). The potential that tailings seepage/leakage would have an indirect water quality impact on wetlands is similarly mentioned only to be dismissed. The FEIS identifies 4,638.4 acres of wetlands potentially indirectly affected by changes in water quality (FEIS, 5-345, Table 5.2.3- 12) only to say that the potential for indirect effects as a result of changes in groundwater quality is “identified to be small.” (FEIS, 5-346). Since the hydrology downstream of the tailings basin is “too complex” to be incorporated into PolyMet’s model for the plant site, again no adverse effects are identified and monitoring is proposed. (FEIS, 5-346). It should be clear from the preceding discussion that the FEIS has not only asserted without grounds that information on wetlands drawdown impacts is “unavailable,” it has systematically provided “conservative” assumptions about potential adverse impacts, only to completely avoid modeling or evaluating any actual adverse indirect impacts on wetlands from the NorthMet project. The replacement offered by the FEIS for assessment and mitigation of adverse indirect impacts on wetlands is monitoring. However, even this monitoring proposal comes with a catch. Potential risks to wetlands are rated based on a system devised by PolyMet, where each different impact factor (several of which are categorically excluded in the above discussion) is given a point from 1 up to a maximum of 6 (FEIS, 5-361, PolyMet 2015b). Monitoring is generously proposed, “within all wetlands containing a potential indirect wetland impact factor rating of 3 to 5 and a sampling of those wetlands with factor ratings of 1 or 2.” (FEIS, 5-390). A quick look at the data reveals that this rating system would place only 3% of the 7,694.2 (or 6,568.8) acres of wetlands in the zone where they would be thoroughly monitored. (FEIS, 5-361, Table 5.2.3-15). Other wetlands would be sampled “based on those wetlands that would have a high likelihood of indirect effects as a result of groundwater drawdown,” (FEIS, 5-397) a definition, as discussed above, that excludes both ombrotrophic and minerotrophic bogs.",WAT,S,O,8,"NorthMet FTB East Dam Conceptual Model June 20, 2014; Groundwater Containment System Modeling in GoldSim v3 January 2015; Barr 2015b; SDEIS Theme WR 018; PolyMet 2015i"
Paula Maccabee,"WaterLegacy’s prior land exchange comments focused on substantive grounds for rejecting the exchange of Superior National Forest lands in order to facilitate development of the PolyMet NorthMet open-pit copper mine. Our concerns in these comments are with the adequacy of the FEIS to analyze the issues that must determined under laws applicable to a land exchange. As explained in the other Sections of this comment, the FEIS inadequately considered the impacts of the PolyMet NorthMet sulfide mine project – the proposed future use of federal lands. The FEIS’ discussion of the land exchange appears to separate the comparison of federal and private lands from the analysis of adverse environmental impacts of the NorthMet project. This distinction cannot be sustained under applicable law.

Paula Maccabee,"These comments, WaterLegacy’s comments on the SDEIS, and the expert opinions and references they cite, demonstrate that the FEIS is inadequate to support the determinations the U.S. Forest Service is required to make. The FEIS has based its conclusions regarding water quality on unsubstantiated assumptions regarding the collection of polluted seepage and leakage, failure to investigate geochemistry, inappropriate selection of compliance points, failure to analyze relevant pollutants, and improper comparisons of pollution with “evaluation criteria” instead of water quality standards and conditions that don’t accurately reflect a no action scenario. The FEIS has used scientifically indefensible methods to minimize mercury impacts and avoid analysis of methylmercury impacts and has, thus, failed entirely to assess a highly significant risk to aquatic life, human health, tribal resources and impacts to Indian trust lands. The FEIS has provided no evaluation of the risks of northward flow of pollutants through the 100 Mile Swamp and to the Rainy River watershed and no evaluation of the indirect impacts of mine site and tailings site dewatering and pollution on wetlands, thousands of acres of which are in the 100 Mile Swamp and the Upper Partridge River, federal lands of high biological diversity.

Paula Maccabee,"WaterLegacy’s comments on the SDEIS referenced EPA’s research, A Field-Based Aquatic Life Benchmark for Conductivity in Central Appalachian Streams,30 which set a benchmark conductivity level for Appalachian streams at 300 microSiemens per centimeter (μS/cm). Since the SDEIS, chemist Bruce Johnson and biologist Maureen Johnson, both former regulators for Minnesota and federal government agencies, have produced a report, An Evaluation of a Field-Based Aquatic Life Benchmark for Specific Conductance (hereinafter “Conductivity Evaluation”), attached as Exhibit 16. Specific conductivity is regulated in Minnesota’s numeric water quality standards to permit use for irrigation with a limit of 1000 micromhos per centimeter (“μmhos/cm” and “μS/cm” are equivalent) applicable to waters and wetlands. Minn. R. 7050.0224, subp. 2, subp. 4. Aquatic life are also protected from pollutants, including specific conductivity, by Minnesota narrative standards that prevent degradation of Class 2 waters and require that “lower aquatic biota” upon which fish depend not be seriously impaired or altered materially. Minn. R. 7050.0150, subp. 3. Minnesota rules apply to aquatic life a test of toxic pollution similar to the XC95% benchmark used in the EPA Benchmark Conductivity Study, which used the 5th centile of a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) as the benchmark value to determine what conductivity level is considered to be “associated with significant biological degradation.”31 Minnesota rules protect the aquatic community from toxic effects, defined to mean “the protection of no less than 95% of all the species in any aquatic community.” Minn. R. 7050.0217, subp. 1, 2. The Conductivity Evaluation applied the methods used by the EPA to develop a specific conductance aquatic life benchmark for Appalachian ecoregions to recommend specific conductance aquatic life protections for three ecoregions in Northeast Minnesota, including the areas that would be affected by the NorthMet project. The Conductivity Evaluation analyzed baseline water chemistry and benthic invertebrate data from the Minnesota Regional Copper- Nickel Study32 and concluded that regional similarities in streams order, unimpacted water chemistry, and populations of benthic invertebrates allowed application to Northeast Minnesota ecoregions the methods used by the EPA to determine a 300 μS/cm specific conductivity benchmark for Appalachian ecoregions. (Conductivity Evaluation, Exhibit 16, pp. 8-14,Table 1). The Conductivity Evaluation used data from taconite mining facilities, including the Dunka Mine, where Duluth Complex rock was removed in order to mine the underlying deposit, to demonstrate that both mine-related seepage and passive wetland treatment have resulted in elevated levels of specific conductivity, often exceeding even Minnesota’s numeric irrigation standard of 1,000 μS/cm. (Id., pp. 14-19). After reviewing testing methods and pollution tolerances of Minnesota benthic invertebrates (Id., pp. 20-24), the Conductivity Evaluation analyzed of the impacts of mining-related specific conductivity on impairments of benthic invertebrates in receiving and downstream waters, include the St. Louis River. (Id., pp. 24-41). Based on the EPA Conductivity Benchmark Study and Minnesota data on baseline and impacted conditions, the Conductivity Evaluation concluded: 1) EPA protocols to set a limit for specific conductivity to protect aquatic life are applicable to Northeast Minnesota surface waters; 2) The median specific conductivity level in all Minnesota Copper-Nickel Study samples (including impacted streams) was 68 μS/cm, so background unimpacted conductivity in this region would be less than 68 μS/cm; 3) Existing data from identified Minnesota ecoregions demonstrate impacts on invertebrate genera from elevated specific conductance in mining impacted waters; and 4) In the Minnesota ecoregions discussed in the Evaluation “discharge of specific conductance above the level of 300 μS/cm, established as guidance for Appalachian streams is highly likely to result in extirpation of 5% or more of invertebrate genera.” Thus, “Such discharge should be prohibited under Minnesota narrative standards preventing degradation and toxic pollution.” (Id., p. 42). In order to protect aquatic life, the Conductivity Evaluation recommended applying the 300 μS/cm aquatic life benchmark for Minnesota discharges in the ecoregions reviewed, pending further analysis to determine if a more stringent limit is needed.

Paula Maccabee,"As detailed in Section I, supra, the FEIS has not addressed WaterLegacy’s comments regarding mercury or the scientific opinions expressed by Dr. Branfireun. Dr. Branfireun’s recent opinion concluded that the NorthMet project could present a substantial and ecologically significant risk of increased production and transport of mercury and methylmercury to downstream waters, including the Partridge, Embarrass and St. Louis River. It is beyond dispute in the medical profession that increasing fish methylmercury in these waters would create human health risks. As Margaret Saracino, M.D., a Duluth child adolescent psychiatrist, summarized in her opinion attached with these comments: In terms of methylmercury, exposure is largely due to ingestion of fish with high mercury content. Methylmercury builds in the food chain. When pregnant women eat fish high in methylmercury, the fetus is then exposed to this lipophilic heavy metal. The placenta is not protective and the blood brain barrier is not well formed until after age two years, which makes fetuses, infants and young children most vulnerable to methylmercury’s neurotoxic effects. Neurons in the developing brain multiply at a rapid rate and are particularly vulnerable to toxic effects of heavy metals, hence brain damage is more likely to occur during this vulnerable time. Neurotoxicity is also transferred to the infant through breast milk. The adverse effects of methylmercury depend on timing and amount of exposure. Methylmercury is a strong toxin that influences enzymes, cell membrane function, causes oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and mitochondria dysfunction, affects amino acid transport and cellular migration in the developing brain. Exposure in utero can cause motor disturbances, impaired vision, dysesthesia, and tremors. Even lower level exposure can result in lower intelligence, poor concentration, poor memory, speech and language disorders, and decrease in visual spatial skills in children exposed to methylmercury in utero. Fetuses, infants, and young children are four to five times more sensitive to the adverse effects of methylmercury exposure than adults. (Saracino, 2015, p. 2). Dr. Saracino explained that neurodevelopmental disorders can be managed, but not cured. (Id., p. 1). In addition to the suffering of exposed individuals and their families, neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from increased methylmercury and lead exposure can result in significant costs to families and communities as a result of needs for occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech and language therapy, special education service, outpatient and in-patient treatment and as a result of reduction in earning capacity. (Id., pp. 2-3). The FEIS neither recognized nor assessed any of these costs.",MERC,S,N,6,Section 3.3.6 of the Final SDD required the EIS to evaluate the potential impacts from methylation of mercury due to increased sulfate concentrations in receiving waters. This scoping requirement is addressed in Final EIS Section 5.2.2.3.4. DNR also notes methylmercury-related health considerations are addressed in FEIS Section 7.3.4.4.2.
Paula Maccabee,"Dr. Ehlinger’s comments on the SDEIS suggested that a health impact assessment be performed “to mitigate or prevent possible negative health outcomes to improve the public’s health.” (Ehlinger SDEIS Comment, Exhibit 17, p.7). As a result of the EIS deficiencies and the human health risks posed by the PolyMet NorthMet sulfide mine project, medical and health organizations and individuals throughout Minnesota have requested a comprehensive and independent health risk and impact assessment be prepared for the project. Excerpts of their letters, which are attached as Exhibit 18, are provided below: Minnesota Nurses Association (March 10, 2014) ""The PolyMet NorthMet Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) contains inadequate analysis of the impacts on public health from the proposal.

We would further request that, in revising the PolyMet SDEIS, a comprehensive Health Risk Assessment be prepared under the guidance of the Minnesota Department of Health."" Minnesota Public Health Association (July 2014) “We write to request a comprehensive analysis of the health risks and public health impacts of the PolyMet sulfide mine project before any decisions are made about this controversial project. . . Mercury contamination of fish and impacts on neurotoxicity in the developing fetus as well as in infants, children and adults is a significant public health concern in Minnesota. Minnesota Medical Association (September 25, 2014) “On behalf of the Minnesota Medical Association, I am writing to offer support for the request that a comprehensive analysis of the health risks and public health impacts of the PolyMet NorthMet Sulfide Mine Project be conducted.

We believe that analysis performed thus far is insufficient to assess important risks to human health and public health impacts of the pollutants that would be released from the PolyMet project."" Minnesota Academy of Family Physicians – Lake Superior Chapter (March 9, 2015) “We join our colleagues in the fields of medicine, nursing, and public health as well as our state Health Department to advocate for the health of our region. A health risk assessment and a health impact assessment are the next critical steps in understanding both the short and long term consequences that PolyMet’s NorthMet project may have on our health.” Minnesota Academy of Family Physicians – Statewide Organization (July 1, 2015) ""The Minnesota Academy of Family Physicians (MAFP) is the largest medical specialty organization in Minnesota, representing over 3000 family physicians, family medicine residents, and medical students. . .

Unsupportable models and unsubstantiated assumptions affect assessment of impacts of surface water and groundwater pollution on human health. The failure to apply Health Risk Limits and Risk Assessment Advice to groundwater further biased FEIS conclusions. The FEIS denial of methylmercury increases and other adverse impacts, results in a failure to evaluate potentially serious threats to human health, particularly to children’s health.

Paula Maccabee,"International headlines, research reports and expert opinions over the past year and a half underscore the fact that catastrophic failure of mine tailings dams is a significant and foreseeable risk. On Monday, August 4, 2014, on a sunny summer day, the tailings dam at the Mount Polley copper-mine in British Columbia, Canada collapsed. The breach released an estimated 24.4 million cubic meters (6.3 billion gallons) of tailings and wastewater into Polley Lake, which rose by 1.5 meters. Hazeltine Creek, which flows out of Lake Polley, was transformed from a 2- meter-wide stream to a 50-metre-across ""wasteland"" and Cariboo Creek was also affected. By August 8, the spill had reached Quesnel Lake, considered until then one of the cleanest deepwater lakes in the world.35 By one year later, water quality in 70-kilometer once-pristine Quesnel Lake had changed. After the dam collapse, Imperial Metals sent water filters to owners around the spill area of the lake: first 50 micron, then 25 micron, then 0.4 micron filters after scientists said a filter less than one micron was needed. These clogged, so the company supplied drinking water. Imperial Metals acknowledged tailings contain arsenic and lead. The Interior Health Authority has issued a bulletin not to eat the fish in Quesnel Lake due to mercury. Many homes and cabins on the lake are vacant or for sale, and residents say both property values and tourism have declined.36 On November 6, 2015, an iron ore tailings dam collapsed at the Samarco mine in Brazil. The dam collapse started a mudslide that flattened a village of 600 people in the historic mining region of Minas Gerais. The fire chief confirmed that 17 people were killed and 50 injured, while others were still missing. The local miners’ union said the sludge was toxic, but the company operating the mine said it was “inert” and contained no harmful chemicals.37 Two weeks later, it was estimated that 60 million cubic meters (nearly 16 billion gallons) of mine waste had been released, requiring 600 people to be evacuated.38 On November 30, 2015, Brazil announced that they would file a $5.2 billion lawsuit against the BHP mine company, and BHP said they would set aside a $260 million fund for community members affected by the spill. A large number of fish had already died.39 Laboratory testing in downstream samples of water from the impacted Rio Doce detected mercury, aluminum, iron, lead, boron, barium, copper, arsenic and other chemicals. Arsenic in sampling after the dam breach was 2,639.4 micrograms per liter -- more than 200 times Brazil’s 10 micrograms per liter standard.40 These may be particularly gripping examples, but they are not uncommon. A July 21, 2015 report by Lindsay Bowker and David Chambers, The Risk, Public Liability & Economics of Tailings Storage Facility Failures (hereinafter “TSF Failures”, attached as Exhibit 19) analyzed recorded tailings storage facility failures from 1940 to 2010 using statistical tools. They found an emerging and pronounced trend since 1960 toward a higher incidence of Serious and Very Serious failures: 49% (33/67) of all recorded Serious and Very Serious failures from 1940-2010 have occurred since 1990. Of all 525 recorded incidents cited, 1990-2010, 17 (33%) were Serious failures, i.e. large enough to cause significant impacts or involved loss of life. Another 16 (31%), were Very Serious failures, i.e. catastrophic dam failures that released more than 1 million cubic meters of tailings and in some instances resulted in multiple loss of life. 63% of all incidents and failures since 1990 were Serious or Very Serious. The total cost for just 7 of these 16 large failures was $3.8 billion, at an average cost of $543 million per failure. (Bowker & Chambers, TSF Failures, pp. 1-2, Exhibit 19) The TSF Failures report noted that very large releases can occur even at a small tailings facility. The Mount Polley tailings storage facility was only about 35 meters high with a total capacity of about 74 million cubic meters (Id., p. 2), much smaller than that proposed for the NorthMet project. The report identified factors contributing to the increase in catastrophic dam failures: mining lower grades and falling real prices of metals, pushing older tailings storage facilities to unplanned heights, or stretching the limits of tailings storage facilities that were not built or managed to best practices in the first place. (Id., pp.1, 2,16). These risk factors would all apply to the NorthMet tailings facility. The TSF Failures report projected 11 Very Serious and 12 Serious failures worldwide from 2010-2020 with a likely $7 billion unfunded cost. (Id., p. 2). Although the TSF Failures analysis did not cover the past few years, the World Information Service on Energy (WISE) has prepared chronology of major dam failures through mid-November 2015, attached as Exhibit 20. Since 2010, WISE has identified 12 major tailings dam failures, including failures in Canada, the United States, and Europe.",GT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"David Chambers’ provided expert “Comments on the Geotechnical Stability of the Proposed NorthMet Tailings Basin and Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility in light of the Failure of the Mt Polley Tailings Storage Facility” on April 30, 2015 (Chambers, 2015, Exhibit 21). These comments identified concerns related to the proposed NorthMet tailings waste storage facility. As a general matter, Dr. Chambers noted that tailings dams fail at a rate that is approximately 10 times higher than that of water supply reservoir dams. (Id., p.2) Dr. Chambers also stated that upstream-type dam construction poses the highest risk for both seismic and static failure of tailings dams and that most tailings dam failures have been associated with upstream construction. Referring to the SDEIS, he noted that the NorthMet tailings facility would use upstream dam construction for its expansion, and would also need to depend in part on the safety of the design and construction of the old upstream-type LTVSMC dams. (Id., pp. 2-3).Dr. Chambers highlighted the presence of a clay layer beneath a portion of the Mount Polley dam as a significant cause of its failure, explaining that the LTVSMC tailings slimes on which the NorthMet project’s tailings dams will be built have a consistency and behavior similar to clays. (Id., p. 3). The FEIS confirms both that the LTVSMC dam was built with upstream construction and that PolyMet still plans to use upstream construction for its tailings storage on top of these old dams. (FEIS, 4-439, 5-646). The FEIS also notes that there were times during the operation of the underlying LTVSMC tailings facility where “significant amounts of fine tailings and slimes” settled near the perimeter dams and dams were then built with coarse tailings on top of them. (FEIS, 4-427) This inclusion of “relatively large zones” of fine tailings and slimes in the dam’s outer shell “reduces the drainage ability of the shell, increasing the phreatic surface, and reduces the localized shear strength” of the dam. (Id.). The FEIS identifies the northern dam in Cell 2E as an area of potential weakness since it is “underlain by a layer of fibrous peat up to approximately 20 ft thick that extends north beyond the toe of the dam into a nearby wetland and due to the presence of interbedded layers of contractive fine tailings and slimes.” A deposit of glacial till lies beneath the peat, and the crest of the dam in this area is about 90 feet above the surrounding ground surface and “consists mostly of coarse tailings with some weaker layers of interbedded fine tailings and slimes close to the base of the dam.” (FEIS, 4-437). Fully liquefied, this cross-section of the dam (Section F) has a margin of safety at barely the 1.1 minimum required. (FEIS, 5-658, Table 5.2.14-1). PolyMet’s Flotation Tailings Management Plan (PolyMet 2015n) states that there are 34 homes that could be affected by a tailings dam break, and that the time to first arrival of flood flows at the nearest residence would be about an hour. (Id., p. 20). The map illustrating the flood path, provided on the last page of PolyMet’s Plan, is attached as Exhibit 22. However, the FEIS does not include any Dam Break Analysis. “The potential effects of hypothetical failure scenarios have not been assessed in this FEIS.” (FEIS, 5-628). WaterLegacy does not argue that the NorthMet tailings storage facility dam will fail, only that such failure is reasonably foreseeable and may have catastrophic consequences. Assessing these consequences is necessary for decision-makers to understand the risks of PolyMet NorthMet tailings disposal and evaluate alternatives to minimize these risks.",GT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes GT 02, GT 03.

Paula Maccabee,"The PolyMet NorthMet hydrometallurgical residue facility (HRF) would be a relatively small facility, when compared to the combined LTVSMC and PolyMet tailings waste storage facility. Although information in the FEIS regarding the chemical constituents of the hydrometallurgical residue facility is incomplete, there is every indication that this facility would contain highly reactive constituents at very high concentrations. Co-Lead Agency responses to SDEIS comments state that 164 pounds of mercury would be deposited in this facility each year. (FEIS, A-414). Over a 20-year mine life, up to 3,280 pounds of mercury could be deposited in the HRF. The February 2007 PolyMet RS33/RS65 Hydrometallurgical Residue Characterization (available as WaterLegacy SDEIS Comment Exhibit 27, although not included among FEIS references) disclosed that hydrometallurgical leachate residue would have sulfate levels of 7,347 mg/L. Although we have found no document in the EIS record that provides contaminant levels for WWTP sludge, before reject concentrate is dewatered it will contain levels of arsenic and metals as much three orders of magnitude above limits and standards. At the P90 level, reject concentrate would contain: 1,150 μg/L of arsenic (2 μg/L criterion for drinking water); 16,600 μg/L of manganese (100 μg/L HRL for drinking water); 847 of cobalt (5 μg/L surface water limit); 11,600 μg/L of copper (9.3 μg/L limit in water with 100 mg/L hardness); 1,290 μg/L of lead (3.2 μg/L limit in water with 100 mg/L hardness); 8,230 mg/L of sulfate (10 mg/L limit in wild rice waters). (Water Modeling Data Package – Mine Site, PolyMet 2015m, autop. 452). As described previously in Section IV of these comments, the NorthMet hydrometallurgical residue facility would be located adjacent to a source of seepage with the potential to build up flow beneath its liner and on top of an LTVSMC emergency basin containing as much as 50 feet of fine tailings and slimes, which was sited on top of wetlands and a fault line and constructed using an upstream construction method. (FEIS, 4-439) The FEIS contemplates that “liquefaction of the hydrometallurgical residue” may occur, but states that the embankment dam is “sufficiently designed so that containment would not be lost.” (FEIS, 5-664). The probability of containment failure at the hydrometallurgical residue facility may be low. But the consequences of releasing thousands of pounds of mercury as well as sulfates and other toxic metals could be catastrophic.",GT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,The FEIS improperly failed to disclose what chemicals would be collected in the HRF and at what concentrations and where they would flow if containment were to fail.

Paula Maccabee,"In discussing the impact of the project on aquatic life, the FEIS provides one mention of spills: a reassurance that “spill prevention plans” would be implemented. (FEIS, 5-467). The FEIS states that an emergency overflow channel would be constructed to discharge untreated tailings pond water as a back up means of controlling pond levels in the event of “a probable maximum precipitation rainfall event or some fraction thereof.” (FEIS, 3-120). The FEIS does not specify what “fraction” of a maximum rainfall event would require emergency discharge or analyze the frequency of extreme weather events given climate change; the FEIS only discusses average increases in precipitation as a result of climate change. (FEIS, 5- 223, 5-254, 5-506). Yet, the FEIS asserts that discharge from the emergency overflow “would not be expected.” (FEIS, 3-120, 5-120). The FEIS does not estimate any adverse impacts of spills or discharge of untreated wastewater from the tailings pond during heavy rains. As discussed previously, despite work plans explaining the uncertainty in performance of engineered systems, the FEIS assumes certainty or nearly perfect seepage collection and provides no assessment of impacts on water quality should routine operations fail to perform as “expected.”",AQ,S,N,11,
Paula Maccabee,"In Minnesota, there is a tendency to assume we are all above average without requiring any proof of performance. It is, thus, worth noting that mining facilities in Minnesota, as well as elsewhere have failed, spilled and leaked. In 1993, an LTV Steel Mining Company coal ash heap at Taconite Harbor liquefied and collapsed after an above-normal rainfall. The system that LTV used to collect surface runoff and leachate and pump it back to the top tier of the ash heap had been approved by the MPCA. Arrowhead Electric Coop. v. LTV Steel Mining Company, 568 N.W. 2d 875 (Minn. App. 1997). In 1990, Northshore Mining Company was penalized more than a half million dollars for violations associated with a tailings pipeline break, including late completion of reports and corrective actions.41 In 2012, Hibbing Taconite discovered a longitudinal crack of approximately 300 feet that had developed suddenly on the crest of its taconite tailings facility dam. HibTac installed a buttress and relief trench as an emergency measure to maintain stability.42 On three occasions between May 2013 and April 2014, failures in an Arcelor-Mittal mine tailings pipeline and a breach in the tailings basin perimeter dike caused the release of about 8,500 cubic yards (1,716,779 gallons) of tailings slurry and aggregate from a washed-out dike road into a pipeline ditch and 15.3 acres of adjacent wetlands.43",GT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS, by omitting any assessment of the adverse impacts of catastrophic or routine failures of containment at the proposed PolyMet NorthMet mine, has created a closed circle in its reasoning. Once certainty of results has been assumed, first by PolyMet and then by the Co- Lead Agencies, neither environmental impacts assessment nor evaluation of alternatives can be done in conformity with law.",GT,NS,X,1,
Paula Maccabee,"X. FINANCIAL ASSURANCE The PolyMet NorthMet FEIS not only fails to specify the level of financial assurance that will be required for the NorthMet sulfide mine project, as previously requested by WaterLegacy. The FEIS fails to provide either the conceptual or factual basis from which an appropriate calculation might be made either by the MDNR for a permit to mine or by the Army Corps for a Section 404 permit. Even to the limited extent that the FEIS addresses financial assurance, it does so poorly, placing much of the risk of externalities on the public rather than on the PolyMet Company, or its parent company and joint venturer - the entities that would profit from the mine. On a conceptual level, the FEIS does not recognize that the only time in the life cycle of a mine when government agencies have any leverage to secure adequate financial assurance is before permits are issued. When a mine is operating, leverage shifts to the mining company, which can threaten closure when asked to pay costs of mitigation or assurance, irrespective of its actual profits. After a mine closes, bankruptcy is likely, particularly when the mine is a limited liability company’s only asset. Unless post-closure contingencies are specifically required to be assured up front, the FEIS’ repeated insistence that PolyMet “would be held accountable for maintenance and monitoring required under the permit and would not be released from financial assurance until all permit conditions have been met,” (e.g. FEIS, 3-5, 3-59, 3-72, 3-127, 3-140) carries no weight. Once an insufficient instrument is exhausted and the mine has closed, taxpayers and the public will be unprotected. The FEIS contains specific statements as well as gaps in analysis that virtually guarantee that financial assurance will be inadequate. 1. The FEIS improperly deferred to the project proponent to set financial assurance. The FEIS implies that PolyMet would play a central role in determining the amount of financial assurance needed. The text states that “PolyMet would ensure that the financial assurance amount is established as a function of (but not limited to) the following three main variables Extent of surface disturbance and potential releases from waste storage facilities Reclamation and long-term care standards (including mechanical water treatment) and Reasonable assessment of the costs to execute the Contingency Reclamation Plan.” (FEIS, 3- 142). That this unfortunate language relates to PolyMet’s role in setting financial assurance levels, rather than the company’s role in financing the level required in the public interest is supported by the next sentence, “PolyMet has developed preliminary cost estimate ranges that address the above items for hypothetical closure at years 1, 11, and 20.” PolyMet’s estimate, the only one mentioned in the FEIS, is then summarized. PolyMet’s cost estimate for closure is $50- 90 million in Year 1, $160-200 million in Year 11, and $120-170 million in Year 20. (Id.). As discussed below, PolyMet’s estimates minimize legacy costs and wastewater treatment costs, exclude risks of poor quality modeling and “unexpected” outcomes, deny and minimize assurance to compensate for wetlands impacts and provide no resources for corrective actions resulting from either routine or catastrophic failures. 2. The FEIS financial assurance estimate discounted existing legacy pollution costs. The only estimate of financial assurance in the FEIS - PolyMet’s estimate - is inconsistent with PolyMet’s disclosure to shareholders of the liabilities associated with legacy pollution. In PolyMet’s Form 20-F, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in April 2015, PolyMet estimated total costs to indemnify Cliffs for reclamation and remediation obligations assumed in PolyMet’s Purchase Agreement as “approximately $72.6 million in present day costs.” PolyMet summarized the litigation against Cliffs and the 2010 Consent Decree applicable to the acquired property and disclosed for investors, “based on the expected timing of such payments, our cost of capital, and anticipated inflation rates, we made a provision of $72.3 million in our financial statements at that date.” (PolyMet Form 20-F, filed Apr. 21, 2015, pp. 18-19, Exhibit 23). PolyMet noted in its disclosure to the SEC, “there is substantial uncertainty related to the long-term mitigation plan implementation cost” and that outcomes “that are unfavorable to us could result in material additional liability.” (Id., p. 19). Before a shovel reaches the site, PolyMet has already estimated that $72.3 million is needed to provide for legacy liabilities. Any financial assurance for the NorthMet mine project must be over and above that amount. Simple arithmetic discloses the discount of legacy pollution costs in the FEIS’ estimate of financial assurance. 3. The FEIS provides no foundation to assure long-term water quality treatment. The FEIS provides no factual foundation from which financial assurance for long-term water quality treatment could be reasonably calculated. The PolyMet NorthMet draft EIS predicted that waste rock stockpile leachate collection would exceed water quality standards for up to 2,000 years. (DEIS, Table 4.1-45, p. 4.1-80, FEIS reference MDNR et al. 2009). Responding to comments of Tribal Cooperating Agencies suggesting that water treatment would need to be perpetual, the Co-Lead Agencies stated numerous times, “Modeling predicts that treatment activities will be a minimum 200 years at the Mine Site and a minimum of 500 years at the Plant Site. While long-term, these time frames for water treatment are not necessarily perpetual.” (Tribal Comments and Co-Lead Agencies’ Dispositions, Aug. 19, 2013, attached as Exhibit 24). An EIS with similar language would provide a basis to calculate financial assurance for water quality treatment. The FEIS provides no such foundation. It states that PolyMet would include funds in its contingency reclamation estimate and financial assurance package to operate mechanical water treatment “for as long as necessary.” (FEIS, 3-81). Although the FEIS admits that the potential effects of the PolyMet NorthMet project are “based on mechanical treatment that would operate indefinitely” (FEIS, 5-8), the FEIS itemization for the financial assurance package in long-term post closure only provides for testing and implementation of non-mechanical water treatment. (FEIS, 3-81). While admitting that the effectiveness of non-mechanical water treatment has not been demonstrated, in listing the long-term post-closure monitoring and maintenance activities that must be assured, the FEIS does not include any provision for WWTP treatment of polluted tailings seepage. The FEIS only provides for “Developing and implementing non-mechanical water treatment systems.” (FEIS, 3-141). Minnesota has experience with post-closure use of non-mechanical water treatment to treat mine discharge when a taconite mine encountered Duluth Complex rock. It is not positive. At Minnesota’s Dunka Mine, non- mechanical water treatment, implemented when the mine went bankrupt and closed its treatment plant, has resulted in consistent violations of Minnesota numeric as well as narrative water quality standards.44 Replicating this cheap and ineffectual plan for the PolyMet NorthMet mine project would be the opposite of financial assurance. 4. The FEIS improperly excluded contingency mitigation from financial assurance. Presumably in response to concerns about assumptions in PolyMet’s modeling of seepage concentrations, seepage capture, and the absence of northward flow, the FEIS has a long list of contingency mitigation and conceptual mitigation options to address the potential that the project will not operate as “expected” and that polluted seepage would flow north to the Boundary Waters watershed. (FEIS, 5-239 to 5-244). It would be reasonable for regulators to require that PolyMet assume the risks of the errors in its modeling or overreaching in its promises. This could be done by financially assuring contingency mitigation and retaining funds pending verification that the PolyMet NorthMet mine site, tailings and hydrometallurgical residue facilities operate as modeled and claimed. The FEIS improperly excludes contingency mitigation from the financial assurance package until some unspecified future time if “appropriate and approved” by the MDNR and MPCA. (FEIS, 5-239). Given the potential that pollution would be discovered after mine closure due to seepage times and the relationship between northward flow and Northshore Peter Mitchell Pit closure, plus the difficulty in securing remediation in Minnesota from an operating mine, let alone a bankrupt mine, it is highly unlikely that funds for contingency mitigation would be secured at a future time if they were needed. By excluding contingency mitigation from financial assurance rather the providing a basis for quantifying these costs, the FEIS has effectively externalized to the public PolyMet’s risk of modeling and performance failures. 5. The FEIS excluded and undermined assurances for wetlands mitigation. The FEIS provides no basis to financially assure compensation for the indirect effects of the NorthMet project on wetlands. By providing no assessment of reasonably foreseeable impacts from hydrologic changes and pollution (see discussion in Section V, supra), the FEIS precludes assurance that compensation will be available when wetlands near the NorthMet mine or tailings site are indirectly destroyed or impaired.

Paula Maccabee,"The PolyMet NorthMet FEIS should have compared the impacts of the proposed action on water quality with an appropriate no action baseline. Despite its assertion quoted above, the FEIS has not evaluated the No Action Alternative, let alone done so in detail. After a 250-page chapter analyzing project impacts on water quality, the discussion of the no action alternative is cursory: “Under the NorthMet Project No Action Alternative, the NorthMet Project Proposed Action would not occur and, therefore, the environmental effects associated with the NorthMet Project Proposed Action, as described in Section 5.2.2, would not occur.” (FEIS, 5-253). Under NEPA, a no action alternative must ""provide a baseline against which the action alternative"" is evaluated. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U. S. Dept. of Interior, 623 F.3d 633, 642 (9th Cir. 2010). (Finding BLM’s approval of an EIS arbitrary and capricious due to flawed assumption regarding result of no action alternative). See also Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. BLM, 746 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1090 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (The “no action” alternative is “the standard by which the reader may compare the other alternatives' beneficial and adverse impacts related to the applicant doing nothing."")

In evaluating the critical impacts of the NorthMet project on water quality, the FEIS explicitly compares the effects of the proposed action with a “Continuation of Existing Conditions” (CEC) scenario, rather than a no build baseline. Every table predicting water quality under the proposed action contrasts it with modeling of this CEC. The FEIS concludes that the proposed action would not cause any significant water quality impacts because “the NorthMet Proposed Action concentrations were no higher than concentrations predicted for the Continuation of Existing Conditions scenario.” (FEIS, 5-9). The CEC is not a no action alternative, but a biased construct. It is a scenario that disregards science, regulation and the proponent’s own obligations in order to compare the NorthMet project’s effects on water quality to an artificially elevated prediction of future pollution. The FEIS, in effect, admits as much. “The CEC scenario,” the FEIS explains, “is not synonymous with the No Action Alternative because it does not account for other foreseeable changes within the NorthMet Project area.” (FEIS, 5-254). The FEIS mentions that actions are currently underway to reduce the sulfate load to the Embarrass River from the Cliffs Erie Area 5NW mine pit. (FEIS, 5-253). But the most significant differences between the CEC scenario and a true no build alternative may involve the LTVSMC brownfield site and tailings waste facility where the NorthMet project is proposed. Under a no action alternative, the existing LTVSMC brownfield site “would be reclaimed in accordance with the Cliffs Erie reclamation/closure plan.” (FEIS, ES-49). In addition, under a no action scenario, if the PolyMet NorthMet project were not built, “the water quality of seepage from the existing LTVSMC Tailings Basin would improve over time as a result of natural attenuation and/or possible additional mitigation measures pursuant to the Consent Decree between the MPCA and Cliffs Erie.” (FEIS, 5-470).

Supp. 2d 1232, 1245-1246 (D.C. W.D. Wash., 2009). Where an agency has ignored its duty, the result cannot be presented as a fait accompli in the baseline for an EIS. Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Kempthorne, supra, 520 F.3d at 1037-38. The LTVSMC taconite tailings plant has been closed since 2000 when the LTV Steel Mining Company declared bankruptcy. Seepage concentrations are naturally attenuating as a result of precipitation and dilution. Cliffs Erie, L.L.C., which became legally responsible for permit compliance in 2001 when it acquired the LTVSMC property, is under the legal obligation of a 2010 consent decree (attached to WaterLegacy’s SDEIS comments as Exhibit 8) to remediate tailings waste facility pollution. The failure of the LTVSMC tailings facility to control seepage and remediate pollution may, to some degree, be a regulatory lapse45 that cannot be considered as a fait accompli in the baseline for an EIS. In addition, under the terms of its purchase agreement with Cliffs Erie, since 2006 the PolyMet Company has indemnified Cliffs Erie for remediation obligations at the tailings site and is “working closely” with Cliffs to fulfill Cliffs’ legal obligations. (PolyMet 2015 SEC Form 20-F, Exhibit 23, pp. 18-19). It would be an improper use of the concept of “no action” to allow Cliffs’ and PolyMet’s delay in taking action to remediate tailings basin seepage to distort the baseline for determining the effects of future sulfide mine pollution. This is not an academic question. As discussed in Section I on mercury, the FEIS claims the PolyMet NorthMet project would reduce CEC modeled sulfate loads to the Embarrass River, at least under the FEIS’ assumption of nearly perfect seepage collection. But, if the NorthMet project’s sulfide tailings seepage were compared with a “no action” baseline, including attenuation and remediation under the consent decree, this evaluation could show the NorthMet action increases rather than decreases sulfate and other pollutants.

Paula Maccabee,"Since the SDEIS was prepared, the Mount Polley copper mine tailings basin suffered a catastrophic failure. (See Section IX, supra). On January 30, 2015, an independent panel of experts released their report, the Independent Expert Engineering Investigation and Review Panel Report on Mount Polley Tailings Storage Facility Breach (hereinafter “Independent Report”) attached as Exhibit 25. The Independent Report analyzed the cause of the Mount Polley tailings impoundment failure and stated, “the dominant contribution to the failure resides in the design.” The Report made the following key recommendation: [T]he future requires not only an improved adoption of best applicable practices (BAP), but also a migration to best available technology (BAT). Examples of BAT are filtered, unsaturated, compacted tailings and reduction in the use of water covers in a closure setting. (Id., at iv) The Independent Report explained, “There are no overriding technical impediments to more widespread adoption of filtered tailings technology.” (Id., at 122) Its Expert Panel challenged the practice of maintaining a water cover over tailings to reduce reactivity, stating that so-called water cover runs counter to best available technology principles and that “No method for achieving chemical stability can succeed without first ensuring physical stability.” (Id., at 124). The Independent Report explained the “intrinsic hazards associated with dualpurpose impoundments storing both water and tailings” and identified as the goal of best available technology for tailings management “to assure physical stability of the tailings deposit. This is achieved by preventing release of impoundment contents, independent of the integrity of any containment structures.” (Id., at 121) To accomplish this objective, the Report continued, “BAT has three components that derive from first principles of soil mechanics: 1. Eliminate surface water from the impoundment. 2. Promote unsaturated conditions in the tailings with drainage provisions. 3. Achieve dilatant conditions throughout the tailings deposit by compaction.” (Id.). The Expert Panel recognized that the chief reason why there isn’t wider industry adoption of filtered tailings is that comparisons of capital and operating costs alone favor conventional tailings dam. The Independent Report recommended that cost estimates include “risk costs, either direct or indirect, associated with failure potential,” emphasizing, “Full consideration of life cycle costs including closure, environmental liabilities, and other externalities will provide a more complete economic picture.

The FEIS doesn’t mention this alternative. Although the request for consideration of this alternative is documented twice - once for the Tribal Cooperating Agencies’ request and once for that of WaterLegacy (FEIS, A-134 to A-135), neither response provides any justification of the failure to evaluate the Mine Site Reverse Osmosis in Year 1 alternative. The Tribes’ request, “provide reverse osmosis treatment at the mine site immediately rather than waiting until year 40 (augment water loss in adjacent high quality wetlands in the Partridge River watershed),” was reprinted in Appendix A, but no response was provided. (FEIS, A-134 to A-135).

Paula Maccabee,"The PolyMet NorthMet FEIS provides an explanation of why the Co-Lead Agencies rejected the alternative of backfilling the West Pit with Category 1 rock generated by mining. This explanation is inadequate. First, the FEIS errs in minimizing the significance of reclamation of its 526-acre surface and the restoration of wetland areas and functions: Removal of the Category 1 Stockpile would allow for reclamation of the affected surface footprint, including potential to recreate wetland areas and restore function, and, as noted above, the prior effect would have been offset through mitigation required for the initial effect. . . However, because of the temporal effect that the stockpile would have, those effects would be required to be mitigated regardless of future backfilling or not. (FEIS, 3- 161 to 3-162) Although the project proponent may see no value in future wetlands restoration if no mitigation credit is received, this perspective is untenable. Reclamation of 526 acres with wetlands within decades instead of never is a clear environmental benefit, The FEIS fails to consider a significant additional environmental benefit of the West Pit Backfill alternative. It would reduce contaminated seepage that would otherwise result from leaving the 526-acre Category 1 copper-nickel waste rock pile permanently in a 280-foot-tall unlined pile at the mine site where seepage could impact the 100 Mile Swamp and the Upper Partridge River. (FEIS, 5-119, Table 5.2.2-21). As detailed in Section II, supra, hydrogeologic conditions beneath the unlined Category 1 waste rock piles are not discussed in the FEIS. But the majority of the Category 1 waste rock pile would be located on semi-permeable Virginia Formation rock, and there are several fractures transecting the site. (FEIS, Figure 4.2.14-1, FEIS ref. Barr 2014b).",ALT,S,O,8,MDNR et al. 2013b
Paula Maccabee,"As with the dry stack tailings alternative, reliance on PolyMet’s unsubstantiated assumptions of nearly perfect seepage collection allowed the Co-Lead Agencies to dismiss the West Pit Backfill alternative without analyzing its potential environmental benefits. Based on PolyMet’s modeling and assumptions (PolyMet 2015h), the FEIS stated that more than 98 WaterLegacy Comment on PolyMet NorthMet FEIS percent of affected groundwater seepage from the Category 1 stockpile would be captured by the containment system or would migrate as groundwater into the West Pit and East Pit (FEIS, 5-7) and that only negligible volumes of uncaptured seepage would flow north. (FEIS, 5-65). These claims are unsupportable. The actual design for Category 1 seepage containment provides for the use of compacted soil as a barrier around the waste rock pile with conductivity specifications generally classified as semi-permeable. (FEIS ref. PolyMet 2015h, pp. 10,13). The drainage system would consist of pipes and ditches and rely only on gravity for collection. (Id., p. 14). PolyMet admits that along the west, north, and east sides of the stockpile, there may be areas where the drain pipe cannot be installed at an elevation low enough to ensure that groundwater will not flow beneath the cutoff wall. It is improbable that this system will work as anticipated. (Lee, Category 1 opinion, 2015). The FEIS’ predictions of minimal Category 1 seepage flow were also based on assumption that the cover placed on the rock pile would reduce infiltration by more than 99 percent (from 360 gpm to 2.8 gpm). (FEIS, 5-145). Geomembranes have not been used for many waste rock stockpile covers or projects approaching the size of the Category 1 waste rock stockpile. (PolyMet 2015d, p. 45). Seepage results from Minnesota’s Dunka Mine, one of the three examples cited by PolyMet (2015d) of similar liner application, have resulted in significant infiltration and contaminated seepage violating Minnesota water quality.

Paula Maccabee,"Placing Category 1 waste rock in the West Pit, after grouting any fractures revealed by mining, may reduce adverse effects from uncaptured release of contaminated seepage to surface and groundwater. Maintaining saturated conditions to reduce oxidation may also be more effective within the West Pit than trying to do so with a cover on a tiered pile. These potential benefits from the West Pit Backfill alternative should have been analyzed in the FEIS. nan",PER,S,N,12,"In considering this comment, the DNR reasserts that the response provided for SDEIS Theme ALT 03 demonstrates adequate consideration of the potential environmental benefits of a West Pit Backfill alternative.

Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS suggests that the environmental benefits from the West Pit Backfill alternative do not require its consideration, let alone implementation of this alternative: T]he potential environmental benefit is moot or outweighed because encumbrance is not allowed in PolyMet’s private mineral leases and because the costs associated with backfilling, additional water treatment (rates), and encumbrance compensation determined in revised lease agreements may affect the ability of PolyMet to secure financing (MDNR et al. 2013b). As such, the option to backfill the West Pit was eliminated from further consideration in the SDEIS and remains so in this FEIS. (FEIS, 3-162) The referenced 2013 MDNR memorandum cited the conclusion of PolyMet’s consultants that the West Pit Backfill alternative “would significantly decrease net return on the project.” (FEIS ref. MDNR et al., 2013b, p. 3). PolyMet’s consultants emphasized, “There are known extensions of mineralization outside the mine plan both to the south (down dip) and to the west (along strike). A key consideration in the development of an overall mine plan for the Project, including the ability to backfill open pits, is preserving potential future development of these extensions of mineralization.”46 Minnesota’s Environmental Policy Act does not allow rejection of an environmentally preferable alternative on the basis of economic considerations, Minn. Stat. §116D.04, Subd. 6. Under federal law, nan",MEPA,S,N,8,"FEIS Section 1.3.2.1, third bullet. DNR disagrees with the assertion that economic factors alone led to the elimination of the proposed West Pit Backfill alternative from detailed analysis in the EIS. Consistent with Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2300, subpart H, the DNR considered the potential alternative against the following criteria: purpose and need; technical feasibility; economic feasibility; availability; and environmental or sociological benefits. Potential environmental benefits were identified. However these potential benefits were outweighed by the economic ramifications associated with the mineral encumbrance.

Ironically, while the EIS has rejected an evaluation that could anticipate and develop an environmentally protective plan for backfilling Category 1 rock, the FEIS also keeps the door open for ad hoc disposal “of some excess waste rock or saturated overburden in the West Pit in areas where mining has ceased, if necessary as an adaptive measure.” (FEIS, 5-630, F-640).",NEPA,S,N,12,"The Purpose and Need of the FEIS is broad enough to evaluate numerous alternatives as the record shows.

Section 1.3.2.4 of the Final EIS addresses this requirement of the rules. Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2300, item G, details the types of alternatives that an EIS should address unless reasonably excluded under three specific criteria, including whether the alternative would not meet the underlying need for or purpose of the project. DNR asserts that the project purpose was appropriately defined and did not keep the agency from considering a full range of alternatives, many of which exhibited elements that were adopted and incorporated into the NorthMet Mining Project proposed action.

Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS denies that the PolyMet NorthMet sulfide mine project would have any adverse impact on “mercury loadings” to the downstream St. Louis River, into which both the Partridge River and Embarrass River drain. (FEIS, 5-10). The FEIS, relying exclusively on Barr data, claims that increases in mercury loading in the Embarrass River from 22.3 to 22.5 grams per year loadings would be more than offset by the decrease in mercury loading from 24.2 to 23.0 grams per year in the Partridge River. (FEIS, 5-572, 6-32). As the result of this alleged “net decrease” in mercury loading, the NorthMet project “is not considered to have the potential for cumulative effects on hydrology and water quality in the St. Louis River.” (FEIS, 6-32) As summarized in Section I, supra, mercury expert Dr. Branfireun has carefully analyzed the Barr mercury data used to support the FEIS, and concluded that it does not meet basic scientific standards for analysis, reporting or addressing the margin of error in data collected. (Branfireun, 2105, pp. 2-9). Dr. Branfireun specifically reviewed the “mass balance” model used by Barr and incorporated into the FEIS and concluded that if an analysis of the margin of error in projections of mercury releases had been performed, the FEIS statements of certainty based on grams of mercury “could not be supported.” Thus, Dr. Branfireun explained, “conclusions from this asserted mass balance that the proposed development will not have appreciable impacts on water quality would be similarly unsupported.” (Branfireun, 2015, p. 14).",WAT,NS,X,1,

Paula Maccabee,"As Dr. Branfireun detailed in his report, the concentration of mercury in fish tissue is not proportional to air deposition. (Branfireun, 2015, pp. 14-15). Sulfate discharge, sulfate air deposition and hydrological changes resulting in the drying and rewetting of wetlands and sediments all contribute to mercury methylation, mobilizing the form of mercury that bioaccumulates in the food chain. (Id., pp. 9-16, 19-27). The wetlands adjacent to the NorthMet project mine site and tailings site are highly methylating environments, and “Even relatively small changes in water table position and wetting and drying frequency in the ombrotrophic wetlands at the NorthMet mine site have the potential to impact sulfate and methylmercury concentrations of receiving waters.” (Id., p. 19). Based on experimental data in similar wetlands, sulfate deposition at the mine site alone could nearly double methylmercury production (1.88 times) in sensitive peatlands. (Id., p. 23). Dr. Branfireun explained the many mechanisms of mercury export from project site wetlands and their transport downstream. (Id., p. 26). He concluded, after the only comprehensive analysis of methylmercury in the entire FEIS record, I reject as unsupported and without scientific justification, any statement or implication in the FEIS that the proposed NorthMet development would not increase risks of methylmercury production and transport in the Partridge and Embarrass River watersheds, particularly in ombrotrophic wetlands near the mine site and wetlands affecting by tailings site seepage collection, changes to hydrology or atmospheric deposition. . . It is my opinion that the NorthMet development could create a substantial risk of ecologically significant increases in water column and fish methylmercury concentrations in downstream waters, including the St. Louis River.

Paula Maccabee,"Mercury bioaccumulation in fish can harm the fish themselves, inhibiting fish reproduction. (FEIS, 5-467). As summarized in the opinion of Dr. Saracino quoted in Section VIII, supra, consumption of fish containing high levels of methylmercury (the form of mercury that bioaccumulates in the food chain) can also be harmful to human beings, particularly to the developing fetus, when methylmercury crosses the placental barrier. (Saracino, 2015). In Minnesota’s Lake Superior Region, the cumulative risk of mercury contamination of downstream fish is highly significant and should have been evaluated. A recent Minnesota Department of Health study found that 1 out of 10 infants in Minnesota's Lake Superior region were born with unsafe levels of mercury in their blood. At a statistically significant level, a greater proportion of Minnesota babies had unsafe mercury in their blood as compared with babies in the Lake Superior region of Wisconsin or Michigan. Mercury levels were also higher in Minnesota in the summer months, suggesting that increased consumption of locally caught fish during the warm months is an important source of pregnant women's mercury exposure.50 In addition to a 1.3 ng/L standard for mercury in the water column discussed previously, Minnesota has a standard limiting mercury in edible fish tissue to protect human health, which is applicable across the range of waters used for fishing and drinking water, of 0.2 micrograms per kilogram (μg/kg). Minn. R. 7050.0220, subp. 3a, 4a, 5a. This standard is lower than the EPA’s methylmercury criterion for fish tissue (0.3 mg/kg) because of the high rate of fish consumption in Minnesota.51 The Embarrass River chain of lakes downstream of the proposed NorthMet tailings site - Sabin, Wynne, and Embarrass Lakes -- are impaired due to excessive mercury in fish tissue. Colby Lake, into which the Partridge River flows downstream of the proposed mine site, is also impaired due to excessive mercury in fish tissue. (FEIS, 4-29, Table 4.2.2-2). Based on the sampling done for the NorthMet project, the Partridge River and Embarrass River may also be impaired for aquatic consumption due to excessive mercury. Mean concentrations of mercury at surface water sites in the Partridge River (2.3 to 5.4 ng/L) and mean concentrations in the Embarrass River (4.3 to 5.1 ng/L) are two to four times higher than Minnesota’s water column standard of 1.3 ng/L. (FEIS, 4-41, Table 4.2.2-4). Most of the St. Louis River downstream of the proposed NorthMet sulfide mine project is impaired for the designated use for aquatic consumption as a result of excessive mercury in fish tissue.

Paula Maccabee,"The FEIS’ analysis of cumulative effects of the PolyMet NorthMet project on sulfate and other pollutants is either misleading or just missing. With respect to sulfate, the FEIS’ analysis contains two critical distortions. First, as explained in Section XI, supra, the FEIS uses an improper baseline to calculate the effects of NorthMet tailings seepage on sulfate concentrations. Rather than comparing NorthMet project impacts to LTVSMC tailings seepage diluted by precipitation over time and reduced by Cliffs Eric compliance with its consent decree, the FEIS creates a biased construct comparing NorthMet pollution with “continuation of existing conditions” contradicting science as well a law. Thus, the FEIS concludes that the NorthMet sulfide mine project would have a “positive effect” on sulfate concentrations. (FEIS, 6-48).",CUM,NS,X,1,

(FEIS, 6-45, Table 6.2.2-3; 6-48, Table 6.2.2-5). Like other FEIS denials of water quality impacts based on unsubstantiated assumptions (see Sections II, III, and XI.5, supra) this cumulative effects assessment is a tautology.

Paula Maccabee,"EPA comments on the PolyMet NorthMet SDEIS recommended, “The FEIS should include indirect impacts in the analysis of cumulative impacts to wetlands.” (EPA Comment on the SDEIS, Exhibit 1). The FEIS provides an inadequate and misleading response to this recommendation. The FEIS’ tables only describe the cumulative losses to wetlands resulting from direct destruction of wetlands by the PolyMet NorthMet project. (FEIS, 6-58). For indirect effects, the FEIS says it is difficult to predict indirect wetland effects either for the proposed project or other mining developments. The FEIS then says, “based on the amount of potential indirect wetland effects that could occur from the NorthMet Proposed Action, there could be 0.1 to 12.0 percent cumulatively lost, in addition to the direct wetland impacts assessed, within the Partridge and Embarrass River watersheds.” (FEIS, 6-60). Read quickly, the FEIS seems to suggest that the upper bound of cumulative impacts on wetlands would be 12.0 percent. This is not the case. If both the Partridge and Embarrass River watersheds are aggregated and indirect impacts are considered, the upper bound of cumulative impacts on wetlands is 17 percent. This is calculated by dividing 11,693 acres of cumulative losses (3,085 acres under the no action alternative and 8,608 acres of loss from the NorthMet project) by the 68,251 pre-settlement acres of both watersheds combined. (See FEIS, 6-56, Table 6.2.3-2; 6-59, Table 6.2.3-5 for presettlement and no action alternative wetlands acreage). However, since most of the cumulative losses from both PolyMet NorthMet project and non-project impacts are in the Partridge River watershed, this calculation understates the impacts to high quality wetlands in the Partridge watershed. The FEIS has provided the lower bound of Partridge River watershed cumulative impacts on wetlands since pre-settlement days. If there were no indirect impacts of the PolyMet NorthMet project on mine site wetlands whatsoever, that cumulative impact would be 10 percent. (FEIS, 6-58). The FEIS does not segregate indirect impacts on the Partridge River watershed. But the GLIFWC analysis of mine dewatering impacts provides a best estimate of indirect wetlands impacts in the Partridge River watershed. Combining GLIFWC’s wetland drawdown estimate (5,720 acres), direct wetlands impacts on the Partridge River watershed (768 acres)52 and losses to the Partridge River watershed under the no action alternative (2,557) and dividing by the presettlement acreage of wetlands in the Partridge River (33,601 acres) provides the likely upper bound of cumulative wetlands loss in the Partridge River watershed based on evidence in this record.53 Cumulative wetland loss and degradation in the Partridge River watershed since presettlement days resulting from the NorthMet proposed action could reach 26.9 percent.",WET,S,N,8,FEIS Section 6.2.3.4.4 addresses cumulative indirect wetland effects.

(WaterLegacy SDEIS Comments, Exhibit 30). The 100 Mile Swamp has been rated for the high quality of its peatlands, while the Upper Partridge River Site is designated due to numerous rare plant species recorded in the site. The 100 Mile Swamp and the Upper Partridge River Site are immediately adjacent to the Headwaters Site, and together these important ecological locations form the headwaters of the St. Louis River, the largest United States tributary to Lake Superior. This spatial relationship is shown in Exhibit 35, a map contained in the MDNR’s report, An Evaluation of the Ecological Significance of the Headwaters Site.54 This report explains, The Headwaters Site straddles the continental divide, with water from the Site flowing both east through the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and north to the Arctic Ocean. Paradoxically, the divide runs through a peatland. Although the peatland appears flat, water flows out of it from all sides, forming the ultimate source of rivers that eventually reach two different oceans.

In fact, the logic behind defining the BBLV Trail as segments rather than as a whole is questionable.

If it makes sense to identify the trail as segments for the purposes of analysis or based on resource categories, i.e. differences in terrain or established logical end points, shouldn’t the agencies validate that assessment by detailing their decision making process within the FEIS? By dividing the trail into segments the co-leads are separating a cultural resource into multiple unrelated features each of which individually may not be significant, but collectively meets criteria as a historic property.

Here in Wisconsin, we have a forward-thinking metallic mining law known as the ""Prove It First"" sulfide mining moratorium, which says that a company wishing to mine in a sulfide ore body must back up its safety claims with evidence that sulfide ores have been mined elsewhere in North America without major environmental contamination.

Carl Sack,"The statement is made on page ES-36 that runoff models predict a net reduction in mercury loadings on the St. Louis River downstream of the Embarrass and Partridge rivers due to wastewater treatment; again, there is no way to test this hypothesis given the lack of testing sites on the St. Louis River itself.",MERC,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme MERC 02
Carl Sack,"Further, the FEIS leaves the public in the dark in regards to where the mine runoff will ultimately end up. There is no map that shows the entire St. Louis River watershed, including the St. Louis River through the Fond du Lac Reservation, St. Louis River Estuary, and the river mouth in Lake Superior. The regional maps included in the FEIS do not show waterways, and thus lead to a false impression of what areas could be impacted by the mine. Waterways should be shown on figures 1.1-1 and 1.1-2 in particular.",WAT,S,O,7,FEIS Section 6.2.2.1.1
Carl Sack,"These impacts may extend beyond the watershed itself to areas chosen as wetland mitigation sites. The fact that there is no way to compensate the 914 acres of wetlands that will be permanently lost on the Mine Site with comparable wetlands elsewhere in the St. Louis River watershed should prohibit the project from moving forward. The FEIS admits that few potential restoration sites of any significant size in that watershed and northern Minnesota in general exist. Those that do could not approach the high quality of the wetlands that will be lost. The Aitkin site that is proposed for mitigation is 100 miles from the mine site and in the Mississippi River watershed, so will not compensate for the loss of wetlands that feed the St. Louis River and Lake Superior. The Hinkley site is even further from the mine site and within a very different ecological context. Any restoration activity conducted by Polymet puts the areas to be ""restored"" at risk of environmental damage. During the DEIS period, Polymet prematurely attempted to “restore” existing wetlands and biologically rich uplands in the Floodwood area to count toward its compensatory mitigation requirement under an agreement with St. Louis County. That agreement was subsequently voided by the Sixth District State Court (Wetlands Action Group vs. St. Louis County, 2007). Polymet should not be trusted to conduct further compensatory mitigation activities. It is also unacceptable that final compensatory mitigation ratios are not included in the FEIS, and thus will be unavailable for public comment when decided upon by USACE.",WET,NS,X,1,
Carl Sack,"Removal of 6,000 acres of biologically diverse habitat unduly impacts the hunting, fishing, and gathering rights of the Ojibwe bands under the 1854 Treaty, regardless of whether the land in question has easy public access routes. Such a large area of habitat destruction will have impacts on species that regularly move beyond the bounds of the mine area such as bear, moose, elk, and wolves. The runoff from the mine may impact the prevalence of aquatic plants and animals, including game fish and wild rice, and may increase mercury contamination in fish tissues that has a direct impact on the health and well- being of Ojibwe people and other local residents.",CR,NS,X,1,
Carl Sack,"Aside from the gravity of the risks from a Polymet mine, the reasons given for permitting the mine in the first place are faulty. The mine is not in the public interest; the only interests served by the Polymet mine are those of Polymet investors. The USACE and MDNR state that the mine would produce “base and precious metal precipitates and flotation concentrates...[that] would help meet domestic and global demand” for these products (page ES-11). However, the ore body that would be mined is a particularly low-grade ore body, and thus mining it is an inefficient way to meet this demand when all economic and environmental costs of the project are accounted for. Of the approximately 11.7 million tons of ore processed per year (32,000 tons per day), about 1% will be yielded as copper, 0.15% as mixed copper/nickel hydroxide, and 0.004% as platinum group element precipitate, according to the figures on page ES-23. This is in addition to the approximately 27 million tons of waste rock that will be produced annually, much of it sulfide bearing and thus environmentally dangerous. A more efficient way to meet domestic and global demand for these metals would be to improve metal and electronics recycling programs, which can reclaim much higher percentages of metals than mining the raw ore of the Northmet deposit. In 2013, metals made up 9% of municipal solid waste, according to the US EPA. Demand could also be reduced by more than the amount of metal the mine would generate by improving domestic source reduction efforts, which involve redesigning products to use less non-recycled raw materials. However, continuing to add metals from raw ores to the world market reduces the economic incentive to bolster recycling or reduce demand; new mining represents a choice to forgo sustainable development. Thus, from a metal supply standpoint, the ""No Action"" alternative should be preferred.",NEPA,S,O,5,"SDEIS Themes NEPA 06, NEPA 09, NEPA 15"
Carl Sack,"The reasons given for the Forest Service land exchange are also faulty. The threat of a lawsuit is not a good excuse for foregoing the Forest Service’s obligations to conserve the natural resources on its lands. Corporations threaten lawsuits to get their way on a regular basis, not fully intending to follow through on their threats. If Polymet is indeed willing to sue USFS over its authority to prevent surface mining on lands with privately-held mineral rights, then the question should be settled by a court of law to set legal precedent for any future cases in which this situation arises. The decision to accept a land exchange leaves this important question ambiguous, but also gives the impression that Polymet's arguments are sound. This is a public disservice and could lead to future scenarios that are disadvantageous to USFS. Unless the law requires USFS to grant surface mining privileges to subsurface mineral rights holders, there is not adequate legal justification for giving the land to Polymet just because they want to mine it, particularly given that the mine would adversely affect the natural qualities of adjacent lands that will continue to be owned by the Forest Service.",NEPA,S,O,5,SDEIS Theme NEPA 04
Carl Sack,"The land exchange sets a precedent for possible future exchanges to facilitate sulfide mining, resulting in cumulative impacts and fragmentation of Forest Service lands. It is no secret that mineral prospecting has been widespread throughout northern Minnesota in recent years, including on Forest Service lands. The possibility that this decision will set precedent for future exchanges was not considered in the Forest Service’s Record of Decision. The land exchange directly facilitates the destruction of 914 acres of high-quality wetlands and 1,719 acres of vegetation mapped by the MDNR as Sites of High Biodiversity Significance without creating any such habitats in exchange. The exchange considers only the market value of the surface property rights of the exchanged parcels without economizing and factoring in the value of the ecosystem services that would be lost due to the exchange. If the biological values and ecosystem services lost due to the exchange were factored into the price of the USFS parcel that Polymet wants to mine—as they should be—significantly greater acreages of privately-held lands would be required to make the exchange even.",LAN,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme LAN 01

David A. Lien,"The best case scenario for the mine anticipates an estimated 500 years of polluted water that will have to be actively treated. And, not all of the polluted water will be captured and sent for treatment. Every year, 11 million gallons of polluted seepage from the tailings basin will enter groundwater without being treated. Every year, over 5 million gallons of polluted seepage from the mine site will enter groundwater without being treated.",WAT,NS,X,1,
David A. Lien,"The plan for an estimated 500 years of active water treatment violates Minnesota Rules (6132.3200) that call for the mine to be left maintenance free at closure. Over 167 million tons of reactive waste rock would be left on the surface after closure. Surrounding this would be a system to collect contaminated seepage that must be monitored and maintained for hundreds of years or longer. A synthetic and soil cover placed over the waste rock pile would require annual maintenance, repairing of erosion, and removal of plants that might perforate the synthetic material. A pit “lake” would be left whose water levels would need to be maintained through pumping to prevent contaminated overspills into the nearby Partridge River. A tailings basin pond would need to have its water levels maintained through pumping to prevent contaminated water from over-topping the dams and entering the nearby Embarrass River. A lengthy network of pipelines conveying polluted and treated water would need to be monitored and maintained for hundreds of years.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 037

David A.

Sulfides also interact with mercury, already toxic, to turn it into its most toxic form: methylmercury.",GEN,NS,X,1,
David A.

And PolyMet says acid-mine drainage (AMD) will be occurring at its proposed Hoyt Lakes mine “for up to 2,000 years.” Less than 1% of the ore would be produced as copper, etc., with waste rock comprising the remaining 99%.",PD,NS,X,1,
David A. Lien,"Former state Rep. Frank Moe is a guide and outfitter on the North Shore. Moe says when his old friends in the State Legislature consider whether to grant a permit to PolyMet to operate a hardrock sulfide mine, they should consider the other jobs at stake. Not just a couple hundred mining jobs, but jobs like his: there are 30,000 people working in the Northwoods recreation economy. Moe asks the legislators and commissioners whether tourists will still come north if the rivers and lakes are polluted. Moe says, “Sulfide mining has a perfect record. A perfect record of environmental damage. There are no examples of a hardrock mining operation without serious pollution.” He likes the Wisconsin model. He wants PolyMet to make upfront financial assurances that will pay for any and all cleanup costs. He doesn’t want taxpayers stuck with the bill, but Polymet says the upfront assurance is a deal-breaker, which isn’t a surprise. Why? Because PolyMet also says acid-mine drainage (AMD) will occur at its proposed Hoyt Lakes mine. The company’s draft Environmental Impact Statement stated that: ? “Water leaching from the waste rock piles is expected to be contaminated for up to 2,000 years;” ? “The West Mine Pit will overflow at Mine Year 65 (45 years after expected mine closure), contaminating the adjacent Partridge River with sulfates and heavy metals;” ? “Due to structural instability, the tailings basin has a ‘low margin of safety.’”",FIN,NS,X,1,

PolyMet says new technology will virtually eliminate the threat of acid- mine drainage. If that’s the case, why won’t they provide up-front financial guarantees? Why is this a deal-breaker if there’s no concern about creating a toxic waste site? Answer: They must not believe their own rhetoric.",FIN,NS,X,1,

However, it does not address the possibility of PolyMet's bankruptcy, however improbable, and that issue concerns me. I have heard about the Zortman-Landusky mine failures in Montana, and while I understand it faced different conditions and was a gold mine, not a copper-nickel, the fact that the state of Montana is still working to pay off repercussions from 17 years ago in my opinion speaks loudly to the gravity of something like that occurring here...

The 1854 Treaty of LaPointe recognizes retained usufruct rights to the Minnesota tribes in ceded territories, and thus a cluster of rights to areas affected by the Northmet Project and the Land transfer that are sufficiently distinct that their concerns should receive evident careful consideration, and this consideration cannot content itself with proclaiming a major difference of opinion without providing the tribes, and the public, the reasons for rejecting the challenges to the assumptions on which the area of potential effect is established or the scientific analysis of the potential effects are based.",CR,NS,X,1,
Michael D. McNally,"Ojibwe people have good reason to question assumptions where so much is at stake in the potential effect on their rights to the ceded land. Ojibwe people’s health and well-being is tied to their lands.

Michael D. McNally,"As a careful reader of these portions of the FEIS, my question from the SDEIS remains: is there evidence of serious consideration and consultation with the tribes. In the FEIS, clearly the consultation and consideration were approached as the scheduling of meetings and the documentation of tribal concerns, and not a serious engagement with the concerns of federally recognized tribes whose views are not those of one among many public interest groups but those with whom the federal agencies involved are under legal treaty based and federal trust obligations to seriously engage, not to push paper to a Chapter 8 where the concerns are summarily dismissed.. The FEIS fails to show serious engagement in Chapter 8. Moving the discussion from the Appendix to Chapter 8 at least makes this oversight in the NEPA review process clearer, but it doesn’t make it any more substantive. I urge an amended FEIS in better keeping with the federal agencies obligations to the tribes, and elaborating on the reasoning behind the 18 “Major Difference of Opinion” that demonstrates a serious engagement with the tribes and tribal agency concerns..",NEPA,NS,X,1,

Elemental mercury is currently not leaching out of the tailings basin because lower levels have had the mercury scoured out through the introduction of sulfates running through them. Mercury is at higher than normal environmental levels in the surface areas of the tailings basin as a result of the absence of sulfates. Once the sulfates are again introduced at the top this mercury will methylate and flow out at higher levels than normal. Water discharge through the lower levels with sulfates will be redirected through the basin increasing the release of methylated mercury currently unexposed in the basin formation at these lower levels. My conclusions are based on studies that I have read on the relationships between sulfates and mercury methylation, DNR studies by Bavin and Berndt and ali other studies, common sense, and not any self serving and deceptive computer modeling.

This disregards the effect of the process water which will be added. The SDEIS can hide the treatment process from us but it appears that it is heavily reliant on some sort of ion exchange as there is an indication that large amounts of limestone will be used. -but lets go pack to the water hydrology for a start. The SDEIS starts by disregarding the hydrostatic effects of the head created by digging the pit. When the pit is dug, the large amount of water surrounding the pit will want to drain into the pit, even with the soil conditions the SDEIS claims exists above bedrock. The SDEIS rely's on a few holes drilled. The entire wall of the pit is the area in issue and not just the surface area of a few holes. When water under surface pressure starts to drain into the bit erosion will further open these holes and create ever increasing drainage into the pit. The holes in surficial and bedrock area around the pit caused by drying and erosion under pressure will form the conduit for migration of contaminants out of the pit post-closure. The pit wall will be close enough to the Partridge River to intersect fractures radiating out from the main fracture creating the Partridge River. The SDEIS tells us that the surficial water flow follows the fractures and that these fractures have associated fractures radiating out from them. This will create drainage into the pit. This drainage into the pit will be more pronounced on the north wall where this water will divert the Partridge River through these fissures and keep the north Virginia formation wall flowing with contaminants that will have to be pumped out to accommodate mining operations. -this leach-aid water will be pumped to the WWTF and run through lime to neutralize it but no system exists where the lime will not get coated will the sulfide metals that are precipitated out and fail to continue to neutralize the acidic water it is intended to neutralize. This process will lead to higher than the .06 to .14 percent Sulfur that the SDEIS indicates will be a base level for the tailings and increase the chances that at least at times the tailings basin will become acidified at a level above the .12 level indicated for acidic conditions. Furthermore, the tailings basin itself contains waste which has become inert. The addition of sulfide and sulfate to the top of the tailings basin will run through the basin and methylize the elemental mercury which is in higher than environmental concentration along with the mercury methylized from the process water, ""sulfate release rates increasing roughly in proportion to total sulfur (p.5-61).""The reverse osmosis, even if the filters stay unplugged and a suitable disposal is found for the filtrate, is not designed or expected to filter out ions that are smaller than water molecules and highly soluble in water.

Arsenic mobility was studied in tailings from Zimapan, a mining zone of Mexico. Primary mineral phases are quartz, calcite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite and arsenopyrite. Secondary minerals in oxidised tailings include gypsum, K-jarosite, lepidocrocite, goethite, beudantite and kaolinite. The highest levels of As (up to 3.95 ± 2.29 weight%), Zn (up to 3.26 ± 2.21 weight%) and Pb (up to 0.93 ± 0.83 weight%) were measured in unoxidised tailings located at the edge of the town. Concentrations in water leachates from oxidised tailings were: As (0.41-48.68 mg/L), Zn (1.5-400 mg/L), Pb (<1.0-1.8 mg/L) and Fe (1.9-897.5 mg/L). Mineralogy, pH, and heterogeneity of tailings, explain these concentration ranges. Arsenopyrite oxidation releases arsenic that is then partly incorporated in secondary minerals like beudantite and K-jarosite.

Laura Gauger,"The PolyMet FEIS claims that the project will be in compliance with state law. To the average Minnesotan, this might mean everything will be okay. But the FEIS fails to elaborate upon the fact that state law and MPCA regulations allow PolyMet an exemption to meeting groundwater quality standards within the company’s property boundary. It doesn’t mean much to be “in compliance” with a law that has provided you with an exemption to meeting its terms. Yet, this important concept is not discussed or elaborated upon in either the Executive Summary or body of the FEIS. Rather, just a few brief references to it can be found buried in Appendix A of the document, where it states that groundwater quality standards will be enforced “at the Mine Site and Plant Site property boundaries, not within the NorthMet project footprint.” The lack of enforcement of groundwater quality standards within the company’s property boundary has not been highlighted for public scrutiny in the FEIS even though, according to PolyMet’s own computer modeling provided by Barr Engineering, the levels of pollutants in the water at the mine site and tailings dump will be many times higher than standards set to protect people, plants and wildlife. The exemption provided to the company seems to have been swept under the rug when, rather, it deserves close scrutiny due to the water-rich nature of the lands in question. Discussions with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) have confirmed that, yes, it’s not until the polluted water crosses the company’s property boundary that groundwater quality standards will be enforced. The agency stated, “That’s the way the law works.” The upshot is this: When the FEIS claims that PolyMet will be in compliance with state law, it’s not that the water within the company’s property boundary will be clean. It’s that the pollution has been legalized. The public needs (and deserves) to know this, especially because we are not talking about a small tract of land where PolyMet will be exempt from meeting groundwater quality standards. Rather, the “groundwater sacrifice zone” associated with the project encompasses over 21,000 acres of water-rich lands in the Lake Superior watershed (including 6,650 acres presently in the Superior National Forest). The lack of transparency of the FEIS on this very important issue renders the FEIS inadequate. The public simply must be provided with greater detail regarding the size and scope of the groundwater sacrifice zone and what that means in both the short term and long term for the Lake Superior and Rainy River watersheds.

Laura Gauger,"On August 11, 2015, the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC; the “Commission”), in coordination with its member tribes, submitted a report into the public record entitled “Comments on PolyMet mine site contaminant northward flowpath and groundwater model calibration.” The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe, a formal cooperating agency in the EIS process, is a member tribe of GLIFWC. The cited report was addressed to the co-lead agencies working on the PolyMet EIS. The Commission’s report stated the following with regard to groundwater flow at the PolyMet mine site: “Detailed (MODFLOW) and simplistic (MathCad) models predict that a northward contaminant flowpath is probable under likely closure conditions.” As the report explains, the northward flow is expected because of a “strong bedrock gradient” toward the existing Northshore Peter-Mitchell taconite mine pits located about a mile north of the PolyMet mine site. According to the FEIS, “Predicted ultimate outflow from the [Peter Mitchell pit] would be from the northeast end of the pit, to the Dunka River in the Rainy River watershed.” The Rainy River system flows through the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and into Canada. The Commission’s report goes on to state: “In addition to potential for northward flow of contaminants in the bedrock ... there is evidence that flow may be to the north in the surficial aquifer,” again related to the proximity of the mine site to the Peter-Mitchell pits. “The drawdown by the over 300 foot deep taconite pits is so great that the surficial aquifer becomes partly dewatered and all baseflow in the upper Partridge [River] ceases.” The Commission’s report conflicts with conclusions drawn by PolyMet consultant Barr Engineering, who had used the same MODFLOW computer program but predicted exclusive southward flow of contaminated waters from the NorthMet mine site to the Partridge River (a tributary of the St. Louis River in the Lake Superior watershed). As the Commission explains, Barr “incorrectly bounded and calibrated” the mine site MODFLOW model, rendering it “unlikely to generate accurate predictions.” In other words: Garbage In = Garbage Out. When Barr’s mistakes were corrected by GLIFWC staff, the MODFLOW computer program indicated that, at closure, “contaminants are likely to flow north in addition to the southward direction currently assumed by project reports.” As stated in Mazina’igan (a publication of GLIFWC), there is concern that “with such a major flaw in [PolyMet’s] evaluation of the groundwater system, accurate predictions to impacts on natural resources are impossible.” Still, for some reason the conclusions drawn by Barr Engineering with regard to exclusive southward flow of contaminated waters from the NorthMet mine site have been and continue to be relied upon by state and federal agencies charged with preparing the PolyMet EIS. Indeed, the FEIS shows little change from the PFEIS or earlier drafts in terms of its focus on the southward flowpath at the mine site. Nor is there any acknowledgement in the FEIS of the errors made by Barr in running the computer model (even though GLIFWC’s findings were issued months before the November 2015 release of the FEIS). A careful review of the FEIS reveals that, instead of incorporating the Commission’s findings into the FEIS and instituting a rigorous review of impacts likely to occur from the probable northward flow of contaminated waters from the mine site, the following new sentence was added to the EIS that, in effect, actually defends Barr’s flawed modeling: “The GoldSim model does not consider a northward flowpath north of the Mine Site facilities as there [is] uncertainty that such a flowpath would ever exist” (FEIS, p. 5-63). This makes no sense at all, based on how the co- lead agencies handled the evaluation of environmental impacts earlier in the EIS process. When Barr originally predicted a probable southward flow of contaminated waters from the PolyMet mine site, that indeed is what drove the ensuing impact analysis, an analysis that resulted in hundreds of pages of the PFEIS and earlier drafts being devoted to an examination of likely environmental impacts from the modeled southward flowpath. Now we have credible evidence that Barr’s computer modeling was flawed and that a northward flowpath is probable (using the very same computer program utilized by Barr, but this time correctly bounded and calibrated). But instead of including a rigorous assessment of potential impacts along the northward flowpath (as the co-lead agencies had required earlier for the then-deemed probable southward flowpath), the FEIS continues to lean on the earlier flawed analysis done by Barr and has devoted a mere 4 pages (FEIS, pp. 5-240 to 5- 244) to a bare-bones discussion of what would appear to be a rather complicated and costly system of “contingency mitigation measures” that perhaps could be implemented in response to a northward flowpath. The northward flowpath, now that it has been shown to be probable by the very same computer modeling program relied upon by Barr, must receive the same rigorous evaluation required by the co-lead agencies of the southward flowpath (which we now know to be flawed). That means the same kinds of analyses set forth earlier to evaluate environmental impacts along the southward flowpath must now be applied to the northward flowpath. Anything less would make a mockery of the EIS process and all of those earlier decisions made by the co-lead agencies when trying to insure adequacy in the EIS process. It’s not the State of Minnesota’s fault, the federal government’s fault, the Tribes’ fault or the public’s fault that Barr Engineering got it wrong or that PolyMet has spent the last 10 years or so providing the co-lead agencies with what we now know to be flawed information. Yet, the co-lead agencies, for whatever reason, have not required PolyMet to reconstruct its impact analysis so that the FEIS might be reflective of true site conditions. For this reason alone, the FEIS must be considered inadequate. As stated in the Commission’s report, “Evaluation of contaminant flow to the north must be conducted and impacts predicted.” What’s more, even though the corrected MODFLOW model shows the northward flowpath is probable, the FEIS states that the “contingency mitigation measures” identified for dealing with the flow of contaminated water northward will not be initially included in the financial assurance package (FEIS, p. 5-239). Again, this makes no sense at all in that it undercuts the whole idea behind financial assurance: to provide guaranteed funding for dealing with probable impacts. The State of Minnesota must not be left holding the bag for mitigation measures designed to deal with the probable northward flow of contaminated waters from the PolyMet mine site. The FEIS must be updated to not only provide greater detail regarding what those measures will be, but to require that they be initially included in the financial assurance package. Anything less would deem the FEIS to be not only inadequate, but negligent.",WAT,S,N,8,"MDNR et al. 2015c. DNR disagrees with GLIFWC’s application of the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model because that agency modified the model outside its intended purpose as defined in Final SDD Section 6.2. The Final SDD required the groundwater flow model to predict pit inflows at various stages of pit development (i.e., year 1, year 5, year 10, year 20) and include operation, closure, and post-closure. The model satisfies this condition of the final scoping decision. GLIFWC changed the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model to include future mining activity at the NorthShore Mine Peter Mitchell Pits, which is outside the scope of the EIS. If the EIS scope were defined to assess of how future activity at the Peter Mitchell Pit might influence the closure conditions at the NorthMet site, then additional data would be required north of the Mine Site on which to refine the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model for : 1) vertical hydraulic conductivity for wetlands and surficial deposits; 2) horizontal hydraulic conductivities in bedrock (e.g., Virginia Formation; BIF); 3) variability of hydraulic conductivities within the bedrock units, and 4) the hydrologic significance of 100 Mile Swamp in providing a source of water for downward leakage. Each of these refinements is important to quantitatively assess the likelihood and potential magnitude of a northward bedrock flowpath. Modeling would also have to reconcile uncertainty regarding the sequence and timing of future Northshore mining operations, including the depth of pit excavations and development of pit lakes relative to NorthMet-related pit conditions during operations and closure. Absent these changes, the results of GLIFWC’s modeling is unreliable for impact assessment. Although not identified as an issue for assessment in the EIS, DNR considered potential future operations at the Northshore Mine against information that is available. DNR acknowledges"
Laura Gauger,"In terms of the sludge and residual solids produced by mechanical water treatment processes at the PolyMet mine site and plant site, the FEIS states that off-site disposal facilities will be utilized for some of the waste, but it does not specify the projected volume of said waste. Nor does it identify where or in which watershed the off-site disposal facilities will be located, the transportation corridor, or if any nearby landfill could even accommodate the large volumes of waste generated over time (potentially hundreds of years). The public needs (and deserves) to know the corresponding details for the PolyMet project, including where the off-site dump(s) will be located. The absence of this information in the FEIS renders it inadequate. In addition, no information is provided in either the FEIS or NorthMet Project Waste Characterization Data Package regarding the composition of the “residual solids” produced by mechanical water treatment processes at the PolyMet mine site and plant site, and only limited information regarding the composition of the sludge is included in the FEIS.

Here’s the analogy: It’s like going to a liquor store and being told the volume of a bottle of vodka instead of being told the volume AND proof.

The FEIS does not specify wetland quality ratings (high v. moderate v. low) for any of the “indirectly impacted” wetlands, even though indirect impacts may still be significant, and even though ratings were indeed indicated for the 913 acres of wetlands deemed to be “directly impacted” by the project.",WET,S,N,8,"The commenter is correct that wetland quality ratings are not provided in Final EIS Section 5.2.3.2.2.

Laura Gauger,"The FEIS characterizes the planned subaqueous disposal of waste rock at the PolyMet mine site as “the preferred method of disposal for the more reactive waste rock” (page ES-23). Sulfide-containing waste rock will be back-filled into the unlined east mine pit, lime will be added in an effort to control acid generation, and water will then resaturate the waste. At first glance, you might think there would be nothing to worry about with regard to the backfill plan. After all, the “preferred method” of handling the waste is being implemented. But using the “preferred” method of waste disposal does not necessarily mean it will be effective in minimizing groundwater contamination. Take the example of the Flambeau Mine, where subaqueous disposal with limestone amendment was utilized as the preferred method of waste disposal. Specifically, the Flambeau mine pit was backfilled with roughly 9 million tons of sulfide containing waste rock, over 30,000 tons of limestone was added to the portion of the waste with the highest sulfide content, and groundwater was then allowed to resaturate the backfilled materials. Preferred method of disposal? Yes. Effective at controlling groundwater pollution? No. Groundwater monitoring within the backfilled Flambeau pit has shown and continues to show failure of the subaqueous disposal technique to control metals leaching. For example, computer modeling done by Flambeau consultant Foth Infrastructure and Environment of Green Bay, Wisconsin (also a PolyMet consultant) predicted a maximum manganese level of about 550 mcg/l in the groundwater within the backfilled Flambeau pit. But now that the real data has started to come in, levels as high as 42,000 mcg/l have been reported – 76 times higher than Foth predicted. The public needs (and deserves) to know that PolyMet’s “preferred method” of waste disposal does not necessarily equate with it being effective at controlling groundwater pollution. The absence of this information in the FEIS renders it inadequate.",WAT,S,N,8,"Final SDD Section 2.5.2 required the EIS to evaluate two mine pits.

The backfilling is considered a component of the progressive reclamation at the Mine Site.

Laura Gauger,"The PolyMet FEIS depends heavily on computer modeling for predicting levels of contaminants in the groundwater at the project site, but the FEIS fails to deal with the fact that this type of modeling has limitations in terms of its accuracy. As alluded to above, computer modeling for the Flambeau Mine supplied by Foth Infrastructure & Environment (also a PolyMet consultant) has proven to be very inaccurate in terms of predicting maximum levels of contaminants in the groundwater within the backfilled Flambeau pit. Here are the numbers: Contaminant Foth Prediction Max Reported Level, to date, now that real data has started to come in Manganese 550 mcg/l 42,000 mcg/l (76 times higher than Foth predicted) Iron 320 mcg/l 15,000 mcg/l (47 times higher than Foth predicted) Copper 14 mcg/l 810 mcg/l (58 times higher than Foth predicted) Sulfate 1,100 mg/l 2,400 mg/l (2 times higher than Foth predicted) The above data has also been graphed (see Appendix B of the Flambeau – v – PolyMet report). It’s an error of omission for the PolyMet FEIS not to have included: (1) a discussion of how computer modeling can sometimes prove to be inaccurate; or (2) provisions for dealing with potential inaccuracies in the computer modeling offered in the PolyMet FEIS. The public needs (and deserves) to have this information in order to decide how much confidence to place in PolyMet’s modeling. The absence of this information renders the FEIS inadequate.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 173-5
Laura Gauger,"Because of the predicted flows of contaminated groundwater from the PolyMet project site toward streams within and beyond the PolyMet property boundary AND because of the potential flow of contaminated surface waters from man-made ponds (non-mechanical water treatment systems) that PolyMet hopes to construct at the project site in the future, mechanisms need to be in place to insure proper enforcement of the federal Clean Water Act. Yet, some of the most basic information needed by state and federal agencies and the public to facilitate the prosecution of potential violations of the Clean Water Act at the PolyMet site is not included in the FEIS. First off, the FEIS fails to designate which waters within or near the PolyMet project site are deemed “navigable” and therefore waters of the United States subject to protections under the federal Clean Water Act. This designation proved crucial in a recent Clean Water Act case waged against the owner of the Flambeau Mine in Wisconsin. I was one of the plaintiffs in that case. If the stream of concern (a tributary of the Flambeau River known as Stream-C on company drawings) had not been designated “navigable” in the Flambeau EIS, the case would have had greater difficulty moving forward in federal court, and it would have been near impossible to try to hold the company accountable for polluting the tributary (which is now on the EPA’s impaired waters list due to copper and zinc toxicity linked to the Flambeau Mine operation). It turns out that even with Stream-C having been designated “navigable” in the Flambeau EIS, the courts failed to award the stream the normal protections guaranteed under the Clean Water Act. But at least we had a shot at it. So how does this factor into the PolyMet discussion? As stated above, the PolyMet FEIS does NOT list which of the streams and creeks or other bodies of water at or near the PolyMet project site are “navigable” and therefore waters of the United States guaranteed protection under the Clean Water Act. This is clearly an error of omission and must be corrected if there is any hope of holding PolyMet accountable for the potential impairment of small but nevertheless navigable waters in the vicinity of the project. In addition, once the navigable waters have been identified, the PolyMet FEIS must provide baseline water quality data for each and every one of them in order for the FEIS to be deemed adequate. In the Flambeau case cited above, baseline water quality data for Stream C was missing from the Flambeau EIS, and, even though the headwaters of the stream were within a few feet of where the high-sulfur waste rock was stockpiled during operations and only a thousand feet or so from where the ore was crushed and loaded onto rail cars, the company would not concede in court that the elevated copper levels in the stream were caused by the mine operation. In turn, this made it more difficult to hold the company accountable for violations of the Clean Water Act. The failure of the PolyMet FEIS to identify any and all navigable waters at or near the project site AND to provide baseline water quality data for them is a set-up for similar enforcement problems in Minnesota.",PER,S,N,11,"Thematic Response Comment #2987. The EIS considers that permitting for the NorthMet Project Proposed Action, if approved, would require monitoring that would likely include water levels and water quality in groundwater and potentially affected waters of the U.S., including wetlands and tributaries. In terms of the ability to regulate project-related discharges, the term “navigable” is not the controlling definition as it relates to applicability of NPDES/SDS permitting. Minnesota Rules part 7050 clearly defines the applicable use classifications, and thus the applicable water quality standards, for each of the potentially impacted streams in the project area. These streams and use classifications prescribed by regulation are described in Table 5.2.2-3 of the Final EIS. This list includes streams to which treated discharges may be directed (e.g., Trimbell Creek, West Pit Outlet Creek) as well as those that do not receive discharges but are near the proposed project (e.g., Longnose and Wetlegs Creeks)."
Laura Gauger,Case in point: The FEIS does not offer baseline water quality data for Second Creek (a tributary of the Partridge River) even though it states that “groundwater in some portions of the [existing LTV] Tailings Basin flows to the south to form the headwaters of Second Creek” and that the creek “could be notably affected by the NorthMet Project.”,WAT,S,N,8,Final EIS Table 4.2.2 - 20. PolyMet 2015j Large Table
Laura Gauger,"Nor does the FEIS comment on whether or not Second Creek is considered “navigable.” The absence of this information in the FEIS will make it more difficult to hold PolyMet accountable, in a court of law, for potential problems that may arise in Second Creek as a result of the mining operation. The same can be said of other navigable waters at or near the PolyMet project site. The State of Minnesota and general public need to know which waters at or near the PolyMet site are “navigable” and what the baseline water quality is for each and every one of them if there is to be any hope of enforcing the Clean Water Act. The failure of the FEIS to provide this crucial information renders the document inadequate.",PER,S,N,11,"Thematic Response Comment #2987. The EIS concluded that permitting for the NorthMet Project Proposed Action, if approved, would require monitoring that would likely include water levels and water quality in groundwater and potentially affected waters of the U.S., including wetlands and tributaries. With respect to the ability to regulate project-related discharges, the term “navigable” is not the controlling definition as it relates to applicability of NPDES/SDS permitting. Minnesota Rules part 7050 clearly defines Second Creek as a “Water of the State” to which applicable use classifications, and thus applicable water quality standards, apply. The regulatory definition and classification of Second Creek is appropriately described in Table 5.2.2-3 of the Final EIS."
Laura Gauger,"Questions have been raised regarding PolyMet’s goal of eventually transitioning from mechanical to non-mechanical water treatment. As stated in comments from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (Section of Fisheries): “The overview of the transitional approach from mechanical to non-mechanical treatment technologies as presented is highly speculative, particularly in terms of success in development of and timing of installation of a successful system.” (Extended comments on NorthMet PFEIS, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources – Section of Fisheries, Comments 4 and 5, 2015). The Department itself, therefore, has exposed the inadequacy of the FEIS to address all issues of importance. Another consideration is that non-mechanical water treatment methods (biofilter and infiltration basin systems) have proven ineffective at the Flambeau Mine site in treating contaminated stormwater runoff. For example, in 1998 (after the Flambeau pit was backfilled), runoff from the southeast corner of the mine site was directed to a man-made biofilter/detention basin in efforts to “clarify collected runoff ” and “improve water quality.” Soil sampling in this particular corner of the mine site, where the ore crusher, high-sulfur waste rock stockpile and rail spur were located during operations, has demonstrated elevated levels of copper that appear to correlate with high levels of copper in runoff. Prior to 2012, the biofilter discharge was directed to a small tributary of the Flambeau River known as Stream C, declared navigable at the time of the mine permit hearing in 1990. Despite non-mechanical treatment of the runoff, however, the discharge consistently contained copper levels exceeding the toxicity standard set to protect fish and other aquatic species (the toxicity standard for copper, adjusted for hardness conditions at Flambeau, is about 3-5 ppb). Environmental monitoring reports show that at times the copper levels in the water exiting the biofilter (e.g., 42 ppb in Sep 2011) were actually higher than the levels measured in the runoff entering the biofilter for treatment (e.g., 17 ppb in Sep 2011), the exact opposite of the desired effect. In 2010 the Wisconsin DNR initiated a study to assess the health of Stream-C and later issued a report in which the Department concluded, “Water quality monitoring done at the site between 2002 and 2011 showed that Stream C and its contributing drainageways contained copper and zinc concentrations that frequently exceeded acute toxicity criteria (ATC). On average, copper exceeded ATC’s in 92% of samples, and zinc exceeded ATC’s in 46% of samples.” Upon recommendation of the Wisconsin DNR, Stream C was added to the EPA’s Section 303(d) Clean Water Act list of “impaired waters,” effective April 2012, for copper and zinc toxicity linked to the Flambeau Mine operation. In early 2012 the owner of the Flambeau Mine converted the biofilter to an infiltration basin (another form of nonmechanical treatment), but this option, too, was a failure. Instead of water percolating downward into the earth with the desired effect of contaminant attenuation, the basin and a second one constructed at the Flambeau site tended to fill to capacity and nearly overtop each year with the Spring melt. As noted by the Wisconsin DNR in an email sent to Foth (the Flambeau consultant responsible for designing the infiltration basins), “we clearly cannot continue responding frantically every spring when the North and East Basins fill up to capacity. This is not a viable management strategy.” The failure of non-mechanical water treatment systems at Flambeau does not bode well for PolyMet’s stated goal of eventually transitioning from mechanical to non-mechanical treatment methods. The PolyMet FEIS is inadequate in that the possibility of outright failure in establishing workable non-mechanical treatment systems has not been fully evaluated.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 137
Laura Gauger,"Even though the hydromet residue basin at the PolyMet plant site will exist in perpetuity and contain some of the nastiest waste products generated by the mine operation, the FEIS states: “It is assumed for purposes of the FEIS that the leakage from this [lined] facility into underlying groundwater or adjacent surface water would be negligible and therefore is not further evaluated.” That’s a big assumption to make, and the FEIS does not provide detailed justification for so doing. Even if the liner beneath the hydromet residue basin remained intact for several hundred years, that doesn’t give PolyMet the right to create a future mess that others may have to deal with several hundred years from now. The public needs (and deserves) to know more about this critical “assumption” made in the FEIS, and modeling needs to be provided for what would happen if the assumption of “negligible leakage” turns out to be wrong.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 138
Laura Gauger,"The section of the FEIS entitled “NorthMet Project Detailed Description,” includes no plans for installing a groundwater capture system around the 207-acre unlined east/central pit (unlike plans clearly outlined in the FEIS for installing capture systems around the 526-acre Category 1 waste rock stockpile and a portion of the 1,325-acre tailings dump). Still, the FEIS states: “During reclamation (year 21-40), ‘water from the East Pit would ... be pumped to the WWTF [Waste Water Treatment Facility] and treated ...’ after which treatment of water in East Pit Backfill may continue into closure and long- term maintenance.” Since the NorthMet plan does not include provisions for installing a groundwater capture system around the unlined mine pit, it is unclear from the limited information in the FEIS how the contaminated pore water will be captured so that it can be treated. Nor is there any indication of how efficient the employed system might be in capturing pore water from a mine feature as large as the unlined pit (207 acres in size, extending up to 700 feet beneath the surface and containing roughly 140 million tons of waste rock). Cleaning up the contaminated water within the backfilled PolyMet mine pit would indeed be a mammoth undertaking. Yet the FEIS provides no real detail for how it might be accomplished (or how it will be handled in terms of the financial assurance package). The public needs (and deserves) to have this information in order to truly assess impacts from the PolyMet project.",WAT,S,N,8,"A well would be installed to extract water from backfill; see PolyMet 2015a, page 70. SDEIS Theme FIN 03"
Laura Gauger,"There have been some rather curious word choices and changes in wording in the EIS as it has moved from the DEIS stage to the SDEIS to the PFEIS to the FEIS. These word choices and changes are curious in the sense that they have actually muddied the waters instead of adding clarity to the final draft of the document. If these sorts of word choices are to be made, the public deserves to know WHO made them, and WHY. Without some sort of personal accountability (i.e., naming names), too many things can be slipped under the rug, to the public’s detriment. For example, please see page ES-26 of the PFEIS and compare to page ES-24 of the FEIS. The former states the following as the lead-off sentence to the first new paragraph in column 1: “Water quality modeling performed in support of the FEIS indicates that water treatment systems would be needed at the Mine Site and Plant Site indefinitely.” The paragraph ends with the following: “Both mechanical and non- mechanical treatment would require periodic maintenance and monitoring activities for as long as treatment is required (indefinitely).” Please compare this to the rendition that appears in the FEIS (page ES-24). The above-cited lead-off sentence was deleted from the corresponding paragraph, and the word “indefinitely” was removed from the final sentence. Instead, the information is now buried in the middle of the first paragraph of the second column, where it’s much less prominent. The information that water treatment systems would be needed “indefinitely” at the PolyMet project site is critical to impact analysis, as reflected by the fact that the above-cited sentence (or variations thereof) appears about 20 times throughout the body of the EIS. Yet, this crucial information was relegated to second-class status in the Executive Summary of the FEIS, the part of the document that would get the most traffic. Whose idea was this? The public needs (and deserves) to know who is masking critical information so citizens might better pass judgment on the integrity of the EIS process (and therefore the integrity of the document itself). A second example: Please compare p. 5-173 of the PFEIS to page 5-174 of the FEIS. It looks like someone was trying to “muddy the waters” by changing phraseology. The term “water quality standards” in the PFEIS was changed to “evaluation criterion” in the FEIS. The average citizen certainly would understand the former phraseology better than the latter. Again, whose idea was this? The public needs (and deserves) to know who is “muddying the waters” in what appears to be an effort to downplay information that justifiably would raise public concern. A third example: Please compare p. 3-2 of the DEIS to p. 3-4 of the FEIS. The DEIS clearly indicates tonnages of the various metals to be produced by the PolyMet operation (and therefore subject to taxation). Yet, the FEIS indicates tonnages of various concentrates and precipitates without disclosing their actual concentrations. As stated earlier, the production values reported in the FEIS are somewhat meaningless. It’s like going to a liquor store and being told the volume of a bottle of vodka instead of being told the volume AND proof. Again, whose idea was this to use funny numbers to describe production values? The public and state decisionmakers need (and deserve) to know real production numbers so they can decide if the environmental risks are “worth it” in terms of potential tax revenues. Curious word choices used in the FEIS: Who decided to call the location of the PolyMet tailings dump and processing plant the “Plant Site” when the vast acreage associated with the site is tied to the dump (3,000 acres) rather than the processing plant (perhaps 200 acres)? o Who decided to use the term “hydrometallurgical residue” instead of the more broadly understood term, “tailings” to describe the waste generated by the hydromet plant? Surely the latter term would have done a better job at alerting the public to the toxic nature of the waste. o Who decided to characterize groundwater drawdown, changes in water quality and other potential changes to wetlands at the PolyMet project site as “indirect” impacts, when those effects indeed would be directly caused by the mine? The use of the term “indirect” in the EIS does not meet the common dictionary definition of the word and, to PolyMet’s unfair advantage, tends to minimize the connection between the mine and what could be some very serious impacts. ? Curious timing of the release of the FEIS: The PolyMet EIS process has been underway for, what, about 10 years now? Yet, someone decided that the 3,500 page FEIS had to be released now, over the busy holiday season (when people need and deserve to have time with their families) and to give the public a mere 30 days to respond. This curious timing has made it more difficult for working-class people in the community to offer comment on this very important decision. Whose idea was it to release the FEIS in mid-November and impose a 30-day deadline over the holiday season? The above are examples of what appear to be questionable decisions made by one or more people involved in the EIS process. It’s time for the co-lead agencies to “name the names” of those who are responsible for what appears to be a thinly-veiled attempt to mask unpalatable elements of the FEIS with “feel good” language and minimize public participation in the review process. The public needs and deserves to know who is really “calling the shots” here so they might better judge the integrity of the EIS process (and therefore the integrity of the FEIS itself). Without this type of full disclosure and transparency, the FEIS must be deemed inadequate.",O,NS,X,1,
Laura Gauger,"Moreover, since the Draft Record of Decision (DROD) issued by the USDA Forest Service regarding the land exchange was “based on the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange,”1 a document now shown to be inadequate and flawed with regard to critical information relied upon by the Forest Service in making its decision, I object to the draft decision authorizing the conveyance of 6,650 acres of federal lands in the Superior National Forest to PolyMet.

It will just accrue. Another way of looking at it is to say that Glencore is merely maximizing its first lien secured position in an impending PolyMet bankruptcy with a sixteen percent interest rate – just to fatten up its claim. If it really supported PolyMet, Glencore would cut the interest rate and give its junior partner a break, and loan it some new money, which it obviously has to have to survive.

Anita Tillemans,"How would a land exchange void the responsibility vested in USFS as the steward of public lands presently in their care? With the proposed land exchange, USFS would be forfeiting its authority to mining interests over lands that were set aside for protection. The Forest Service would be trading, not only lands, but a trust that these ecosystems would be protected from exploitation for generations to come. Polymet will be mining water resources, destroying wetlands, by their own admission; and, in effect, degrading natural resources, flora and fauna, with its lease to continuously extract metals in an open-pit mine. They will be requiring permits to do all of this, including permits to take endangered species on lands that the Forest Service was given in trust, lands that USFS would need to trade in order for mining to occur. In addition, this would help establish precedent that could facilitate more land exchanges of this type. By trading these lands, USFS would, essentially, be demonstrating a lack of will in exercising its authority. This land exchange, essentially, would create a barter system that conflicts with the USFS’ role as steward and allows exploitation. By any reasoning, the land exchange cannot be reconciled with this public trust.",LAN,NS,X,1,
Anita Tillemans,"Is it wise to risk the security of the St Louis Watershed, one that feeds the greatest freshwater lake by area in the world, Lake Superior, and lies at the extreme headwaters of the St Lawrence River? All life depends upon reserves of water; and the Arrowhead is at the source of one of the largest supplies on Earth. St Louis River, at the extreme headwaters of the St Lawrence Seaway, supplies freshwater to Lake Superior and the Great Lakes. Products of the Laurentide Ice Sheet melt, Rainy Lake, Lake of the Woods, and Red Lake formed in the basin of Lake Agassiz, which extended over 170,000 square miles, possibly the largest freshwater lake ever (similar in size to the Black Sea). This glacial lake provided water to northern Minnesota, the Red River Valley and may still be discharging its glacial waters from the fractured metamorphic bedrock aquifers of the Arrowhead. The FEIS confirms that bedrock of the region has low conductivity and could take thousands of years to discharge. In addition to the glacial waters of Agassiz, others glacial lakes like Norwood, Upham and Aitkin, products of the LIS, as well, have discharged their waters into the Arrowhead of Minnesota. Diverse moraines such as the Vermilion Moraine, left evidence in patterns of glacial till that can be seen around Babbitt, Ely, the Embarrass River area, and Hoyt Lakes, overlain in many areas by lush vegetation and lakes. Covered by such a luxuriant carpet, the land that Polymet and others want to mine can be as difficult to inspect for existing aquifers, confined or otherwise, as it is to locate existing faults and fractures of bedrock in the area. This does not mean they don’t exist. The fact that the NorthMet Project prospect lies within the boundary of the Vermilion Moraine, along with the BWCAW and Ely, makes this even more difficult. The potential of water traversing aquifers through fractured metamorphic bedrock, sight unseen, is heightened. No one spot duplicates another, essentially with variations in depth to bedrock by hundreds of feet, coverage of waterlogged vegetation and lakes, and a diversity that is like no other on earth. Like faults, aquifers can be inferred invariably through their effects. Observe the copious discharge of water from the Big Stoney along the north shore of Minnesota. Observe the waters that so readily flow from the area of the Mesabi Widjiu, in rivers like Prairie River and Swan River from the Hill of Three Waters, the Vermilion River, St Louis River, Rainy River, and the great Mississippi. All one needs to do is observe. As faults and fractures allow water to disperse in bedrock, these aquifers eventually find outlet in rivers, streams, fens, wetlands, falls, ponds and lakes at varying distances and directions from the site of recharge in the Laurentian Uplands. According to the FEIS, surficial aquifers surrounding the mine site have a low conductivity, though not as low as bedrock in the same area, which supposedly decreases with depth. In this environment, then, it took thousands of years for glacial waters to make their way to the basin of Lake Superior. These waters can be seen dispersing in rich wetlands and rivers throughout; and they continue to nourish land in the Arrowhead supporting a vast and intricate ecosystem. Does it make ecological sense to place a copper mine where it can do so much harm to water resources, with the potential of collecting into highly toxic sludge, polluting more and more of the surficial aquifers of the region, as waters are made stagnant and dead over the years? There will be floods. There will be upheavals, as history proves ... waters will disperse, as it is the nature of water to do. What will be left after the mine extracts precious reserves of water from aquifers, seen and unseen, confined or not, to process metals that serve its profit margin? Will there be any wild areas left, named or unnamed, categorized or not when the pollution from concentrates, waste rock and filters have found their way through this valuable ecosystem and the watersheds of the Arrowhead? Our national security depends upon protection of freshwater resources, and the Arrowhead stands as a source of one of the largest fresh water reserves on earth. No copper mine is worth the risk of degrading this precious resource.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Anita Tillemans,"How can protection of a species be reconciled with destruction of habitat and nesting sites? Since the various animal species do not pay attention to lines drawn on a map, they will trespass naturally. Water knows no real boundaries, either, over time; and time is the key word. In time, all things great and small in this water dependent ecosystem will be affected by actions proposed today in the Arrowhead. The FEIS notes, that approximately 1,535 acres (58 percent) of mature forest would be lost at the mine site alone, that the species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) found at the mine site would be birds from Table 4.2.5-1 and that they would be “displaced.” The FEIS goes on to state that it is likely these birds would not be injured or killed, though nesting birds could be affected. The FEIS states that the mine would not likely affect individual migratory songbirds or other bird species protected under the MBTA; but would likely affect habitat and nest sites used by them. How does one “affect” another’s home, without affecting the individual; and, as a matter of course, disturb nesting sites without disturbing the propagation of a species? With time, more species than those cited by the FEIS would be “affected” in the course of their reproductive cycles; and this, in turn, would naturally affect survival of a number of species in the area.",WI,S,O,2,FEIS Section 5.2.5
Anita Tillemans,"What security is there in a mining economy that depends entirely on the market, one that will not contribute to the real long-term wealth of this area? Such an economy based on mining depends on the whims of a market. Copper mining will pollute the resources essential to our survival, perhaps into perpetuity, while providing profits and wealth to relatively few people over twenty years, more or less. After the mines have gone, as we see today, there will be masses of unemployed people, desperate, in a failing economy. Recycling metals is on the upswing and processes for this type of recovery are being more fully developed as the North Met Project is being pondered. This could make mining for copper less profitable in a very short time. The price of commodities will vary, and markets are fickle. As a consequence, copper cannot guarantee a secure future, and certainly not a green economy in the Arrowhead. Statistics abound concerning the wealth of wilderness tourism; and it cannot be reconciled with a mining scenario. When the copper mines are gone, what will be left? The choice is truly between wilderness and mining. Transport down scenic highways to and from the NorthMet Project will weave a web far beyond the sites that FEIS reviewed. Tourists will be traveling down the Superior National Forest Scenic Byway, along highways and roads to Hoyt Lakes, Embarrass, Ely, Babbitt and Silver Bay. These potential long-term customers will see the effects of mining and it will affect the tourist industry. The sounds of blasting, trucks and drilling are not conducive to wilderness by any stretch; and neither is the potential of streams and waterways polluted with sulfuric acid and other toxins from mining copper. Atmospheric conditions are unpredictable and Polymet will not be able to control these. The sounds of drilling from exploratory wells for copper and other metals can be heard in the BWCAW at this time. If Polymet gets permission to pollute and take lands in the Laurentian Uplands, there will be little peace for these areas, no chance of true wilderness experience and tourism. Jobs that create a steady future do not lie in mining a land that, once mined, is degraded. Fields that once grew wild rice, grow no more. Waters that held rich stores of fish are dead and dying. Ecosystems fail and waters need constant treatment. Wetlands that once held diverse flora and fauna are no more. This is not security.",NEPA,NS,X,1,
Anita Tillemans,"The FEIS did not adequately address the potential effects of fossil fuels on the atmosphere surrounding the NorthMet Project. Fossil fuel needs will escalate at LTV and the mining site, fuel and coal needs for the plant and mine, fuel for the vehicles, the crushers, the earthmovers and trains. Acid rain will emerge as an even greater problem, and the FEIS did not address this issue sufficiently. Repercussions will be felt in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, most certainly, from atmospheric effects alone. Coal fired plants have provided energy to mines along the Mesabi Range for decades and, in the last 50 years, signs of acid rain have degraded foliage and forests in the path of their plumes. Witness dying birch, and mountain ash (that have all but entirely disappeared along the North Shore of Minnesota). The effects of a copper mine in this fragile ecosystem will reach far beyond the boundaries of the plant and mine sites with potentially devastating effects.",AIR,NS,X,1,
Anita Tillemans,"This FEIS does not address known fractures, fault lines within the project site, and those along the Range. What of the Waasa and Camp Rivera Faults? What of the Vermilion Fault? The effects of faults and fractures have been downplayed in models, which were made to inform the FEIS. The connectivity of bedrock with surficial aquifers assumed to be low, and the upper surface of fractured metamorphic bedrock assumed to be fractured more heavily at the top than down under. This conclusion seems convenient and arbitrary, since these structures cannot be truly known, sight unseen. Is there some reason that Polymet did not use the available information on inferred faults for more in depth field study on these particular areas? The devil is always in the details. Though details can be used to obfuscate and avoid larger issues, these particular details are major omissions in a study that assumes to represent a truthful picture of the potential risks involved to groundwater from seepages and discharge through cracks, joints, fractures, faults, bore holes, from waste rock, slurry and tailings basins in the Laurentian Uplands. Inferences are made all the time in science, through reason and implication, through the use of data and study. All knowledge is brought about in this way. To discount information on inferred faults is careless. The FEIS makes its own inferences. It infers that bedrock has low conductivity around the site and plant. It infers that the pollution would not travel far from the sites. It infers that all systems will operate sufficiently as expected over the lifetime of the mine and into perpetuity. It infers that, if a fault is found, it will be dealt with successfully. It infers much in supporting a copper mining scenario. Details and independent, in depth fieldwork is still needed concerning bedrock aquifers, faults and fractures in the area because of their potential for being conduits of pollution into ground water reserves, sight unseen. Polymet admits seepage will occur, but it continues to minimize the risks through assumptions concerning the conductivity of fractured metamorphic bedrock and sand and gravel aquifers throughout the area. Water will most assuredly traverse aquifers and find the path of least resistance. The FEIS minimizes and leaves these pathways open to conjecture with promises that all will be handled, in time.",GT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 012
Anita Tillemans,"Potential effects that can be caused by drawdown in artesian springs, are given little review and field study, limited by assumptions and documents supporting the FEIS conclusion that bedrock geology plays a small part in hydrology of the area. At the same time, we are assured that if there are, indeed, fractures, faults and confined aquifers found during operation, or that drawdown becomes a problem, these issues will be dealt with at the time. Of course, once an artesian has been drawn down, the chances of drawing it back up are limited. At this point, there does not appear to be any technology that can guarantee the renewal of an aquifer, or restoration of ground waters fouled?",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 087
Anita Tillemans,"Considering the importance of geology in this complex area of Minnesota, the FEIS omits much in detail. Ground water in the Laurentian Divide frequently diverges from surface topography and therefore locations of recharge and discharge can be impossible to predict. Polymet’s probabilistic models cannot possibly be informed adequately to address the enormous danger of mining water, drawdowns, depressurization of artesians, and upwelling of brackish water to name only a few dangers posed by this project. In the process of review, some of the most relevant information appears to be missing from the FEIS, or discounted, much of the obvious geological and hydrological evidence that would prove a no action alternative best for the environment and for the habitants upstream and downstream of the proposed mining project. For instance, significant evidence on the fractured metamorphic nature of these lands, inferred and actual fractures and faults that have been named, the prospect of artesian springs, other faults and fractures in bedrock that may conduct water from the site, the potential that water inflows are much greater by many accounts have been given short shrift in deference to a computer model fed with data chosen, in particular, for this study. It all seems quite arbitrary, and these omissions are significant. The area that includes Babbitt, Hoyt Lakes and the transportation corridor are covered with sand and gravel surficial aquifers, which run the possibility of overdevelopment in irrigated areas. This region also includes igneous and fractured metamorphic bedrock aquifers, where water can be found in cracks, joints and fractures within otherwise solid rock formations. Hoyt Lakes is a land of sand and gravel buried aquifers, which can be a major source of water (eg the Biwabik formation). Further down the St Louis River, in addition to sand and gravel surficial, and buried aquifers, igneous and fractured metamorphic bedrock aquifers, there are also sedimentary bedrock aquifers. Even though yields from these sedimentary cretaceous deposits are supposed to be low, the possibility that ground water discharges in lowlands from sand and gravel and fractured aquifers, also in the area, certainly exists. Igneous and fractured metamorphic bedrock aquifers line the North Shore of Minnesota where there are over sixty water features in falls, rivers, and streams. The St Louis Watershed drains a basin of over 3500 square miles at the extreme headwaters of the St Lawrence Seaway. It appears that waters from glacial lakes, formed during the melt of the Laurentide Ice Sheet might still be discharging into Lake Superior as these waters work their way through the fractured bedrock aquifers of St Louis, Lake and Cook Counties. As noted, FEIS confirms that due to low permeability of the bedrock, discharge could take thousands of years... and so it seems that polluted waters could do the same. Polymet would be long gone before the consequences of copper mining could be fully assessed. The FEIS avoids much discussion on differentiating major geologic areas, although Ely, Babbitt, Hoyt Lakes, Embarrass, the BWCAW and the whole of Giants Ridge are encompassed in a single one of these regions. The FEIS avoids in depth review of the existence of confined aquifers (extremely important in the security of the groundwater), avoids discussing in particular dissimilarities in surface composites and bedrock as relates to their conductivity and connectivity, specifics on the variability of depth to bedrock, inevitable flooding scenarios, weather anomalies, likely spills and exposures, drumlin fields, watershed anomalies (for instance, the fact that the tailings pond at the LTV plant has outgrown what was once the boundary of the Vermilion Watershed, redrawn on maps to put it within the St Louis Watershed). Polymet’s NorthMet Project will increase the size of this tailings pond and so it is crucial to understand fully the hydrology of both surficial and bedrock aquifers directly underlying this tailings pond in particular. Metamorphic rock is mentioned very little in the FEIS, as it fails to note that most of the Arrowhead is covered by fractured metamorphic rock, and in the area of the project, that sand and gravel surficial aquifers are prevalent as well, major omissions in outlining the geology of the area. Through these errors of omission, the probability of surficial and bedrock transport appears minimal at best.

Anita Tillemans,"Due to the precedent that a copper mine in Babbitt will set, if granted, the potential for mining pits and tailings basins surrounding the area of the BWCAW watershed will be greatly increased. Exploratory wells have been made well past the northern boundaries of the St Louis River Watershed, into the Rainy River Watershed, and on the boundary of the BWCAW. As a consequence, if the North Met project for a copper mine is granted, this will create the potential of a succession of mining pits and wells that move from the NE of Giants Ridge into the domain of the BWCA Wilderness. Consequently, the NorthMet Project prospect has the potential of affecting a larger area than the study proposes. Elevated levels of arsenic can be found in the BWCAW along with brackish waters from exploratory wells. These details cannot be overlooked because it foretells the real possibility of pollution from Polymet’s mine pits traversing aquifers and connecting the St Louis Watershed to the Rainy River Watershed. The potential of surficial and bedrock connectivity from the mine site to this highly diverse geology of the BWCAW region through fluid and interconnected wilderness waterways, glacial moraine and diverse geology is relevant to the discussion.",CUM,NS,X,1,
Anita Tillemans,"Relying on probabilistic outcomes that narrow the view and minimize the prospect of pollution reaching downstream seems unrealistic. The potential of downstream contamination throughout the St Louis River Watershed should be given full consideration in any responsible environmental study concerning the prospect of a copper mine in this ecologically important area at the headwaters of the greatest body of freshwater on earth. The St Louis River Watershed is composed of tilted bedrock planes that lean toward Lake Superior. Some of this can be seen in Jay Cook State Park, downstream from the prospect. The topography of the Laurentian Uplands and the swampy lowlands is diverse, including beds of wavy bedrock and washboard effects in areas like the Toimi Drumlin Field. The diversity of topography is as great as the diversity of flora and fauna. These areas are hardly flat. Consider that the final drainage of the Laurentide Ice Sheet is said to have occurred around 8200 YBP and this caused sea levels to rise between 2.6 to 9.2 feet. Can the inevitable flow of local waters to the sea be discounted in a study that truly represents the risk of pollution from a copper mine? Lake Superior is the product of glacial waters that flowed from the LIS and from glacial lakes that grew from the LIS melt. The St Louis River developed in the basin of Glacial Lake Upham. Relative to the age of this earth, the rivers in Minnesota are young, still cutting paths to the sea. If downstream effects were given due merit, the facts would be clear that the entire Arrowhead of Minnesota would eventually suffer loss and damage from the operation of a copper mine in the Laurentian Uplands.

Turning ownership of National Forest Lands over to a private mining company would be contrary to the Forest Service’s mission: it would not serve the people well and it would demonstrate the very opposite of caring for the land.

More, it would apparently degrade surface waters and groundwater to the extent that they would not meet state, federal and tribal water quality standards. The ROD does not acknowledge, nor does the FEIS weigh heavily enough, the harm that would be done to vulnerable species, including moose, lynx, and northern goshawks. The ROD and the EIS do not indicate serious consideration of the loss of ecological services so that all of those benefits can be weighed against the mining company’s gains. This exchange would mean the destruction of 700 acres of imperiled Black Spruce – Jack Pine Woodland, now protected as part of the Superior National Forest, and among our favorite places for birding, botanizing, and hiking. Many other special plant communities - some micro habitats that are easy to miss for most of us, yet still significant, and including rare species and many sites of High Biological Significance, as identified by Minnesota Biological Survey, would be traded away - in most cases with no equivalent replacement. Lands that the Forest Service would gain ownership of in the exchange are for the most part already used in ways that are consistent with the Forest Plan. There is no great advantage, in terms of land use, in bringing them under Forest Service management.

One example of this flawed understanding is the error in baseflow calculations, which is carried forward in the MODFLOW hydrologic modeling.6 At the mine site, MODFLOW under-predicts the amount of water that would flow into the mine pits and thus under-predicts the amount of water treatment needed for both short and long term closure.

The MODFLOW model cannot generate reliable outputs for these and other environmental impact predictions, because it was calibrated to conditions that did not exist at the same point in time: water levels in the Northshore Peter Mitchell taconite pits from 1996, and Partridge River baseflows from 1979-1988. Furthermore, the MODFLOW model fails to incorporate the Peter Mitchell pit elevations predicted for closure conditions, which will be 300 feet lower than the bottom of the NorthMet pits.

Unfortunately, each of these potential contingency mitigation actions, individually or in combination, actually represents a significant departure from the existing Project, as it has been defined for environmental review.

This scenario is physically impossible, but despite repeated requests by the tribal cooperating agencies to have a technical discussion with the Co-lead agencies about this theoretical groundwater mound, they have flatly refused to do so. It is truly unfortunate, in the context of an environmental impact disclosure process, that this absurd basis for rationalizing the dismissal of a valid technical criticism has apparently justified the Co-lead agencies ‘waving away’ serious consideration of likely Project impacts.

Nancy Schuldt,"In a report comparing predicted and actual water quality at hard rock mines, two types of characterization failures were identified that led to differences between the predicted water quality in EIS documents and the actual water quality either during or after mining began.26 These included: (1) insufficient or inaccurate characterization of the hydrology The authors reported primary causes of hydrologic characterization failures as overestimations of dilution, lack of hydrological characterization, overestimations of discharge volumes, and underestimations of storm size.27 (2) insufficient or inaccurate geochemical characterization of the proposed mine.28 The primary causes of geochemical characterization failures were identified as lack of adequate geochemical characterization, in terms of sample representativeness and sample adequacy.29 The primary causes of mitigation failures were that mitigation measures were not identified, were inadequate, or were not implemented; waste rock mixing and segregation was not effective; liners leaked; tailings were spilled; or embankments failed, and land application discharge was not effective.

The FEIS does not speak in terms of ‘compliance’, but rather ‘probabilities of exceedances of evaluation criteria’, which are not synonymous with water quality standards. In presenting only modeled probabilities and frequency distributions in their “data” tables and figures, it is challenging, if not impossible, for the general public to understand the significance of the numerical information in the FEIS.",NEPA,NS,X,1,The possibility of northward flow between the proposed NorthMet Mine and Northshore Mine is speculative and is not reasonably foreseeable based on current information.

Nancy Schuldt,"Evidently, the public is expected to uncritically accept the Project proponent’s conclusion that a 700‐ft deep open pit sulfide mine, with a 526‐acre permanent reactive waste rock stockpile, a pit lake requiring water treatment in perpetuity, a tailings basin that has already contaminated ground and surface water that now will also host reactive sulfide tailings, and a permanent hazardous waste facility constructed within a wetland, will collectively result in only two exceedances of water quality standards – and they are not even directly attributable to the Project Proposed Action! This astonishing conclusion is a result of flawed modeling assumptions (baseflow, hydraulic connectivity, etc.), dubious decisions on data usage (omitting ‘outliers’, concentration caps, etc.), fuzzy compliance thresholds, and inordinate reliance on engineering controls that must perform flawlessly, most of them in perpetuity. In short, the assurances provided in the FEIS Executive Summary are not supported by the underlying analysis. Surface water quality remains insufficiently characterized or left uncharacterized, and the defects in analysis are profound in this area. The limited data used indicates that surface waters have already been adversely impacted by mining activity, which should give rise to more scrutiny, not less.30 Contaminant transport modeling suggests that the Project will cause manganese, aluminum, and sulfate to exceed Minnesota Water Quality Standards (“MN WQS”).31 Mercury, sulfate, and specific conductance already exceed surface water criteria in surface water samples collected near the tailings basin at nearby Area Pit 5, and mercury and aluminum exceed surface water criteria in the Partridge River downstream of Colby Lake.32 Aluminum, iron, manganese, and mercury all exceed MN WQS in Colby Lake.33 Contaminants from the Project will likely contribute additional loading to these existing exceedances of MN WQS in the Embarrass River, Colby Lake, and the Partridge River. It appears that, as a result of the Proposed Project, arsenic will exceed drinking water standards in Colby Lake.34 There have not been any water samples collected from lakes in proximity to the tailings basin (Hiekkilla, Mud, Kaunonen, or Hay Lakes) to determine if the pollutants found in the surface and groundwater at the existing tailings basin have caused contamination of those waterbodies.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 071. FEIS Table 5.2.2-32
Nancy Schuldt,"The claim that 100% of the seepage from the tailings basin can be captured is implausible and is unsupported by authority. The Tribes requested that the Co-lead agencies or their contractor provide references for a similar facility to the 90% or greater capture efficiency rate they were confident could be achieved (which was also claimed in the SDEIS); they were not able to provide a single example from anywhere in the world. The Co-lead agencies provided a single citation from a USEPA guidance document (generally intended to inform solid waste sites) that revealed: [M]most barriers in the study have been in place for fewer than 10 years; therefore, long-term performance can only be extrapolated... All sites included in the study were existing sites that had vertical barriers and, in many cases, caps. None of the sites has an engineered bottom barrier. Therefore, the effect of leakage through aquitards was not evaluated in this study. Regardless of this study’s applicability (or lack thereof) to seepage capture systems proposed for the PolyMet Project, the EPA found that 10% of the reviewed containment systems failed to meet the desired performance objectives and required corrective action. An additional 19% of the evaluated facilities did not have sufficient data to conclude weather the containment system was operating successfully or not. There is no information on the effectiveness of any of these facilities at timeframes remotely comparable to what will be required for PolyMet. In the EPA study, ‘long term’ is considered 30 years, whereas the seepage capture requirements for PolyMet facilities are on the order of centuries for the flotation tailings basin and category 1 stockpile, and in perpetuity for the hydrometallurgical residue facility. None of the facilities in the study are as large as the one proposed by PolyMet. A search for examples similar to the Project Proposed Action identified the Zortman-Landusky mine in Montana, which installed containment and pumpback systems to be used in conjunction with a wastewater treatment facility. However, they “did not capture all surface and subsurface drainage”. At the Molycorp, Inc., mine site in New Mexico, “The pathway for contaminant migration is the leaching of tailing seepage downward from the tailing facility to ground water that migrates through fractures to surface water.” Examples of similar seepage capture systems installed and operating in northeastern Minnesota are at the US Steel-MINNTAC tailings basin, and the former LTV tailings basin seep SD0026 (the same tailings basin PolyMet proposes to re-use), and demonstrate capture rates of less than 60%. The US Steel -MINNTAC tailings basin is of similar age and design as the former LTV tailings basin that PolyMet proposes to reuse. Both are large, unlined facilities that are designed to allow massive volumes of water to seep to surface and groundwater in order to maintain structural stability. Both facilities have been discharging many thousands of gallons per day of high sulfate wastewater into the environment for decades. US Steel-MINNTAC, as required under a schedule of compliance for their long-outdated NPDES permit, has begun constructing a multi-phase seepage capture system that is intended to bring the facility into compliance with applicable water quality standards. The capture system is similar to the one proposed by PolyMet, in that it consists of a trench for capturing seepage and a pumping system that would return tailings effluent back into the facility. The US Steel-MINNTAC system was originally intended to extend to bedrock, but that proved impossible in some locations because of the presence of large boulders within the glacial till that hindered construction. Because the surficial geology is similar at the LTV facility, it is likely that similar difficulties will be encountered by PolyMet, which will significantly decrease expected seepage capture efficiency. It is important to note that seepage capture of greater than 95% would be required at MINNTAC in order to achieve compliance with applicable water quality standards.However, at this facility, this high capture efficiency was concluded to be infeasible, and MINNTAC predicted that their capture efficiencies would not exceed 60%; actual performance of the capture system is below 50%. The primary purpose of this system was to achieve compliance with MN WQS, yet the capture system alone will not be able to achieve that goal. The primary purpose of the seepage capture at the Proposed Project is to achieve compliance with MN WQS, but it is not likely to be successful, based upon limited but relevant regional experience. The FEIS acknowledges that seepage from the existing LTV tailings basin continues to drain south to Second Creek long after LTV operations have ceased47. PolyMet and the state regulatory agencies are fully aware that that this seepage pumpback system is not nearly as effective as claimed in the SDEIS48. According to MPCA staff, the pumpback system has not resulted in the water quality improvements required under the Consent Decree, so there are two modifications currently proposed by Cliffs Natural Resources: 1) dewater the pond that is an additional source of water contributing to water quality concerns (pending a US EPA wetlands determination); or 2) create an additional barrier (dam) for seepage collection and pumpback between the existing dam and monitoring station SD026.49 But the need for evaluating water quality impacts is simply dismissed by the statement “PolyMet has committed to future upgrades to achieve 100% capture by this system if the NorthMet Project Proposed Action is approved.”50 There has been no bedrock hydrogeologic study at this site to even determine what possible engineering alternatives would be effective in capturing 100% of the seepage that surfaces to the south of the tailings basin.",WAT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WR 018, WR 020, WR 101"
Nancy Schuldt,"There is simply no evidence to support the rosy scenario that PolyMet will be able to capture 97% of the shallow seepage and 90% of the deep seepage from an unlined, purposefully ‘leaky’ tailings basin, despite the Co-lead agencies’ assurances. The FEIS has not adequately evaluated the impacts of polluted tailings basin seepage to Second Creek and the Partridge River.",WAT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WR 018, WR 020, WR 101"
Nancy Schuldt,"The unsupported prediction of complete seepage capture efficiency is unfortunately carried forward into other critical analyses. The FEIS claims that construction of a groundwater containment system along the north, northwest and west sides of its unlined tailings basin “would capture virtually all of the Tailings Basin seepage presently flowing in those directions to restore water quality” (FEIS 5-186 (based upon PolyMet 2015(d)). Without even a single bedrock monitoring well installed to confirm or deny this assumption, the FEIS maintains that this is prediction is “conservative”, because the modeling done by PolyMet assumes that bedrock hydraulic conductivity is “negligible” (FEIS p. 5-29). Disturbingly, the tailings basin model uses storage coefficients that are not found anywhere in peer reviewed scientific literature51.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS COOP Response #9063
Nancy Schuldt,"These parameters are highly critical for establishing a reliable model, because the volume of groundwater that a geologic formation can contain (storativity or storage coefficient) and the rate of flow (hydraulic conductivity) are functions of the amount of open pore spaces or fractures/faults in rock, the quantity of water that infiltrates from the surface, and the groundwater gradient. The storage coefficient incorporated in the plant site model (including the tailings basin) for bedrock is 0.20, and for the surficial deposits 0.0002 (FEIS 5-46, Table 5.2.2-9), suggesting that the bedrock contains several orders of magnitude more water than the surficial deposits. When questioned about these extraordinary storage coefficients, the Co- lead agencies’ explanation was that the model was “calibrated to match predicted and measured groundwater levels”. Essentially, this model is simulates a bedrock ‘storage tank’ where large volumes of water go in but virtually nothing comes out. Since this is not conceptually accurate, the modeled hydraulic conductivity and/or modeled storage coefficients cannot be relied upon to estimate the amount of seepage that will bypass the seepage capture system, or the amount of time before seepage upwells to surface waters in adjacent wetlands and the Embarrass River, where MN WQS must be met.",WAT,S,O,3,"SDEIS COOP Response #19659.

Nancy Schuldt,"The FEIS maintains that mine pit dewatering impacts will be very limited or non-existent based on an assumption carried forward from the DEIS that there is little or no connection between the bedrock and surficial aquifers. This assumption is based solely on an unsupported “professional opinion,” when in fact there is ample evidence that there may be substantial connection between the bedrock and surficial aquifers. Such a connection indicates that dewatering the mine pits could cause significant drawdown of the water table in the surficial aquifer, potentially dewatering wetlands and ephemeral streams.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS COOP Response #19664
Nancy Schuldt,"Tritium and unionized ammonia nitrogen were found in water samples collected from two deep boreholes in the area where the Project mine pits will be located. Both tritium and unionized ammonia are classic indicators for a strong connection with surface water. Tritium indicates water found in the deep boreholes was surface water that originated post-1952, during or after nuclear testing. The boreholes are approximately one mile southwest of the Peter Mitchell Pit, which is the closest and most likely source of this pollution. Production at the Northshore mine started in 1955. Review of the Peter Mitchell Pit discharge monitoring data for SD001 from 2006 and 2008 shows the average concentration of unionized ammonia exceeded their 0.04 mg/l NPDES permit limit. Unionized ammonia and tritium in the deep boreholes suggest that travel time of contaminants through bedrock fractures will be on the order of decades, not the hundreds or thousands of years that are assumed in the FEIS.

Nancy Schuldt,"The lack of fracture and fault analysis remains a major deficiency in this FEIS. The map provided by GLIFWC in their SDEIS comments, Geologic Faults at the PolyMet Mine and Plant Site59, indicates: 1. There are several faults extending from Northshore pits to the PolyMet mine site. This may explain why there is ammonia and tritium in the deep borehole samples. 2. There is an inferred fault running right through the area of the Hydrometallurgic Residue Facility. (Not only is the HRF proposed to be constructed within wetland, with a buried stream and springs, but it will also be receiving seepage from the tailings basin and it could be geologically predisposed to facilitate groundwater movement. 3.

Nancy Schuldt,"The FEIS also diminishes the lessons learned from the Dunka Pit, located on the former LTVSMC site approximately five miles north and east of the PolyMet Project mine site. Within the Dunka Pit, LTVSMC contacted the Duluth Complex and the Virginia Formation while mining for taconite in the Biwabik Iron Formation.60 By 1991, LTVSMC had removed about 50 million tons of Duluth Complex material from the Dunka pit and placed it in “gabbro” stockpiles.61 Monitoring of the drainage from these stockpiles beginning in 1976 revealed a decrease in pH and an increase in trace metals.62 Copper and nickel concentrations as high as 1.7 and 40 mg/l respectively were observed in seepage/run-off from the Duluth Complex waste rock stockpiles and pH was observed as low as 5.0 at seep 1 between 1976 and 1980.63 Most of the seepage from waste rock piles at the Dunka site was discharged to Bob’s Bay in Birch Lake via Unnamed Creek.64 A 1976-1977 study of trace metals in Bob’s Bay found that concentrations of copper, nickel, cobalt, and zinc in the water of the Bay were higher than regional average concentrations and decreased with distance from the mouth of Unnamed Creek.65 Additionally, it was determined that Unnamed Creek contributed more than 90% of the trace metals load to Bob's Bay.66 The NPDES permit for this discharge expired in 200567 and another variance request is expected. A WWTF located at the site has been inactive because Cliffs Erie, LLC, the owner who acquired the property from LTVSMC, declared bankruptcy and claims it is simply too expensive to continue running.68 Unfortunately, the passive wetland treatment system did not function well enough to remove nickel and copper in waters still discharging from the mine pit and stockpiles to a concentration that complies with MN WQS.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS COOP Response #19669

Nevertheless, predicted water quality impacts and ineffective mitigation methods referenced in the Study were unheeded when the technical documents and FEIS were drafted for PolyMet.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS COOP Response #19668
Nancy Schuldt,"Similarly, the Mining Simulation Project (funded in part by a Minnesota Legislative appropriation of $185,000 to the MNDNR and MPCA) was a cooperative study to identify and resolve environmental issues associated with non-ferrous mining and to anticipate industry and government data needs to address those issues before commercial development occurred in Minnesota.72 The study clearly identified those state ground and surface water quality regulations that would apply to copper-nickel mining operations in Minnesota, including applying the 10 mg/l sulfate criterion to effluent discharges where wild rice is present; it prioritized nondegradation of both surface and groundwater and protection of groundwater as a drinking water source; and it rejected using natural wetlands for mine effluent treatment (“as a toxic metals dumping ground”).73 The tribal cooperating agencies have also consistently elevated our concerns for the Proposed Project’s potential to adversely impact groundwater quality and quantity. “Groundwater maintains stream flows and wetlands during dry periods, supporting significant ecosystem functions. Groundwater is an important source of drinking water in the Great Lakes Basin, where 8.2 million people, or 82% of the rural population, rely on groundwater for their drinking water.”74 In Minnesota, all groundwater is protected for drinking water supplies, “constituting the highest priority use, and as such, to provide maximum protection to all underground waters.”75 When considering water allocations, drinking water is supposed to be considered the highest priority by the MN DNR.76 According to MPCA’s groundwater profile for Northeastern MN including the Project area: “Glacial aquifers are commonly thin and limited in their extent and yield. Bedrock aquifers have limited yield, generally from fractures; groundwater movement is difficult to define. There are no large-scale regional aquifers. The Biwabik Iron Formation is the only source of groundwater for many Iron Range cities.”77 Yet despite the importance of this critical resource, the FEIS has not adequately evaluated the potential for impacting drinking water sources, and it is clear from the state regulatory agencies’ uncertainties about the frequency, volume, and water quality of other mine discharges (i.e., the Peter Mitchell Pit) even while regulated under permits, that this issue remains a significant deficiency in the FEIS analysis.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS COOP Response #19670

Assuming that all spillage of the coarse material would occur in a 2-meter-wide strip on both sides of the centerline of the railway (total width equals 4 meters) over the entire haul distance after loading (approximately 8 miles or 13,000 meters), results in approximately 0.11 kilograms per square meter (kg/m2) of ore fines annually or 2.14 kg/m2 for the 20-year NorthMet Project Proposed Action. This equates to 0.002 inch of depth annually or 0.05 inches for the 20-year NorthMet Project Proposed Action”. (FEIS page 5-313). However, the above FEIS language is incorrect because PolyMet 2015q, Section 8.4.3 (page 101) actually says “Assuming that all spillage occurs in a 2 meter wide strip along this portion of the rail corridor, it is estimated that approximately 2.78 kg/m2 could spill annually or 55.7 kg/m2 over the life of the Project. This is equivalent to 1.25 inches of spilled material over a 2,000 m2 area”. The values of “total width = 4 meters”, “0.11 kg/m2”, “2.14 kg/m2”, “0.002 inch of depth annually” and “0.05 inches deposited for the 20-year Project” mentioned in the FEIS actually come from a different document - PolyMet 2015b (page 57, Section 5.2.3.2.1). These numbers also appear in Attachment D to PolyMet 2015b, which is a 2012 memo from Barr Engineering (PolyMet 2015b, page 259/273). There are three issues that arise from the above discussion.

Some liners are damaged during installation, but most damage occurs when the liner is covered by drainage or protective soil.82 The relevance to water quality predictions is again linked to model inputs.

The east equalization basin receives drainage from the haul roads, the RTH, pit dewatering and the Category 1 Waste Rock Stockpile drainage, with relatively lower sulfate and metals concentrations but still requiring ultrafiltration/nanofiltration.83 If a substantially higher (and more realistic) rate of concentrated contaminant leakage to groundwater is incorporated into the mine site water model, it would likely result in significantly different water quality model predictions.",WAT,S,O,8,"Golder Associates Inc.

Nancy Schuldt,"The FEIS states that the current fish tissue concentrations in the five local lakes that were studied result in Hazard Quotients (HQs) that exceed 1, but gives no further interpretation in the text of the document. The Cumulative Impacts Analysis, Local Mercury Deposition and Bioaccumulation in Fish (July 2012) (Barr report) provides the actual HQs for these local lakes. While Table 6.2.6-1 of the FEIS does contain these values, they are not pointed out in the text or expanded upon. The highest HQ is 46.2, times the health-based target. It is difficult to understand why, despite repeated requests by the tribes, no further discussion is provided of a HQ that exceeds a health-based target by such a large number. The report also ignores the fact that the HQ of 46.2 is for tribal anglers, whereas the highest HQ value for recreational anglers is much lower, at 6.2. This is very obviously an issue of environmental justice, but the FEIS completely ignores issue this other than by saying “Note that the current fish tissue concentration in the five lakes results in Hazard Quotients that exceed 1, leading to the need for the fish consumption advisories currently in effect”.93 The Barr report also states that “the existing health risk under Scenario 1 and 2 to subsistence/tribal and subsistence anglers eating three pounds or more per week of fish from these lakes would be significantly higher – up to fifteen times the EPA assumed safe risk intake level for a pregnant mother or child under the age of 15”. While the incremental risk from the Project may be small, the existing risk is large and has not yet been addressed through a total maximum daily load (TMDL) or other reduction program. Figure 9 from the July 2012 Barr report should be included to give the public a clear idea of the existing condition of the local waters and why the tribes believe that no additional mercury should be added at this time.

Therefore, as provided in multiple comments on the preliminary SDEIS, Fond du Lac conservatively assumes that water treatment for the proposed PolyMet mine is perpetual and the FEIS should be clear on this issue.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 035
Nancy Schuldt,"However, instead of clarifying this factor, it appears that the Co-lead agencies are attempting to minimize the significance of the necessity for long term/perpetual treatment by repetitively using vague and confusing language in the FEIS. The specific language describing long term water treatment has changed during the development of the document, even though the model results have not. The Colead agencies use creative wording to obscure the results of the modeling; this is misdirection at best and highly inappropriate for the Co-lead agencies to present to the public.",NEPA,S,O,3,SDEIS COOP Response #19625
Nancy Schuldt,"In addition to water treatment, there will also need to be a substantial investment in long-term or perpetual operation, maintenance and replacement of other environmental controls for the Project, including seepage capture and pumping at multiple locations at both the mine site and plant site, repair and replacement of liners, managing appropriate stream augmentation and Tailings Basin pond elevation, and pumping, treating, and disposal of seepage from the HRF: The rate of drainage would decrease over time as the pore water within the hydrometallurgical residue is collected and removed. Once the entire facility is closed, the volume of water from the drainage collection systems would decline. In the long term, the volume of water requiring treatment would decline to the point that the remaining reclamation activity may consist of periodic pumping of remaining drainage into tank trucks for transportation, treatment, and disposal, as appropriate, and of inspection of the closed cells to verify integrity of the reclamation systems. ...The water quality of both mine pits, however, is predicted to improve over time as the pits become flooded, thereby effectively eliminating oxidation of the pit walls, the primary source of solutes, except for the upper few feet where water levels may fluctuate. Figures 5.2.2-41, 5.2.2-42, and 5.2.2-43 show how the water quality in the West Pit is predicted to improve over time for three representative solutes: cobalt, nickel, and sulfate. It is expected that eventually the solute concentrations in the pits would stabilize to more or less steady-state values, although the timeframe for this would likely be greater than 200 years as indicated by Figures 5.2.2-41 to 5.2.2-43, which show solute concentrations continuing to decrease at year 200, although still above the evaluation criterion. These predicted improvements in water quality suggest that the WWTF may not need to operate permanently, but that at some point, non-mechanical treatment systems may be sufficient to meet water quality based effluent limits. The FEIS frequently states the long-term goal is to transition to non-mechanical treatment, but there is little evidence to suggest that current treatment technologies can consistently treat large volumes of water to meet WQS. Furthermore, constructed wetlands would require substantial acreage to handle the volume of wastewater that will perpetually be collected, and do not function well in our cold climate for at least half of the year (when vegetation is not actively growing). They are not likely to be able to treat wastewater sufficiently to consistently meet water quality standards, including the wild rice sulfate criterion. Given the absence of scientific or evidentiary support, it is irresponsible for the FEIS to sustain the myth that long- term water quality maintenance at the Project area can ever transition to non-mechanical treatment.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 035
Nancy Schuldt,"However, the true legacy of this Project, should it be permitted and operated, will be the unquantified volume and mass of contaminants that will be released to groundwater, untreated and in perpetuity, in both the Partridge and Embarrass River watersheds (and ultimately the St. Louis River), and to the north (and ultimately the BWCAW). Some of this contaminated groundwater will ‘daylight’ to surface water features, including streams and wetlands, and will result in unacceptable hazard to aquatic species and wildlife dependent upon these waters. This is not conjecture; existing ferrous mines have already adversely impacted surface and groundwater resources (private drinking water wells near the tailings basin; aquatic life use impairments identified in the final MPCA 2012 303(d) list) from what the regulatory agencies consider relatively ‘benign’ ore bodies and the customary permitted mining practices (i.e., storage of waste rock, “leaky” unlined tailings dumps). Contaminant loads from even this low-grade, disseminated sulfide ore will be significantly more toxic than the releases that Minnesota waters have received over the past century of ferrous mining. Furthermore, peak concentrations in this contaminated groundwater won’t reach surface waters until many decades after closure. There is no analysis in the FEIS that acknowledges, let alone addresses, the perpetual and uncontrolled release of highly contaminated groundwater, affecting water resources far beyond the Project boundary. The FEIS requires substantially more public transparency and less equivocation on what is arguably one of the most fundamental issues at stake for this Project: how long will the company be required to flawlessly operate and maintain expensive mechanical treatment to comply with MN WQS? Clearly there are other engineering controls and management actions that will also have to operate faultlessly and that will require maintenance in perpetuity (seepage collection, liners, pumps, waste rock stockpile cover systems, waste disposal, stream augmentation, Tailings Basin pond elevation management).

Nancy Schuldt,"Despite repeated requests for a clear response from the Co-lead agencies, the tribal cooperating agencies still do not know what PolyMet will be required to do, or when they will be required to do it, regarding their legacy contamination liabilities. The FEIS does not provide sufficient information for the public to understand whether the NorthMet Project Proposed Action will be required to remediate these and other AOCs before commencing Project operations, or be allowed to defer remediation until closure. It is not clear in the FEIS how the Voluntary Investigation and Cleanup (“VIC”) program requirements will be applied to PolyMet:",HAZ,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme HAZ 05
Nancy Schuldt,"Cliffs Erie (now Cliffs Natural Resources) was party to a Consent Decree and approved work plan(s) with MPCA regarding their remedial responsibilities, but there is little information in the FEIS for the public to be assured regarding the need for PolyMet to enter into a legally binding agreement and develop approvable work plans to address their responsibilities. We understand that PolyMet has been coordinating with Cliffs on the reissuance of the Tailings Basin NPDES permit (and variance too, apparently), and incorporating corrective actions in their Project design, but the FEIS is virtually silent on the other AOCs. It seems reasonable to expect PolyMet to clean up all legacy contamination as quickly as possible; in fact, remedial actions should be integrated with the ‘refurbishing’ actions they plan to do to re-tool the taconite processing facilities to accommodate their processing needs. The FEIS should clearly acknowledge in its analysis of the No Action Alternative that, under the existing Consent Decree, Cliffs Natural Resources is required to complete remediation and reclamation/closure activities on the identified AOCs, and absent the NorthMet Mining Project, these requirements would not be deferred for 20 years. The Project Proponent has frequently touted the redevelopment of a ‘brownfield site’ as evidence of its environmental sensitivity, but the public may not realize that the actual cleanup of LTV’s legacy contamination may be deferred until reclamation and closure of the NorthMet Project. In fact, four of the AOCs identified in Table 4.2.1-2 as PolyMet liabilities stipulate in the “status” column to “Further investigation at PolyMet closure.” This timeline is not acceptable, and the FEIS should not be vague about the pace of fulfilling remedial requirements. Instead, the Co-lead agencies should stipulate in the FEIS a clear requirement that PolyMet will provide an approved Work Plan and expedited remedial timeline for all 23 remaining AOCs on their property, as a condition of the DNR Permit to Mine.",ALT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme ALT 14
Nancy Schuldt,"The initial description of wild rice’s preferred habitat and life cycle118 is strangely silent on one of the most significant - and regulated - water quality parameters under evaluation for Project impacts: sulfate. The Co-lead agencies acknowledge that distribution and abundance of wild rice is dependent upon specific habitat requirements, including “Water chemistry – wild rice grows within a wide range of chemical parameters; however, productivity is highest in water with a pH of 6.0 to 8.0 and alkalinity greater than 40 mg/l “(FEIS 4-31). Yet there is no background or context provided for the section titled Regulations Applying to Waters that Contain Wild Rice. Minnesota’s sulfate criterion for the protection of wild rice waters has been in approved state rules since 1973, and has been the subject of considerable controversy, legislative overreach, and accelerated experimental research throughout the entirety of the PolyMet environmental review process. The tribal cooperating agencies have, concurrently with our involvement as cooperating agencies for the EIS process, been engaged with the MPCA in consultation on the state’s legislatively-directed water quality rules revision for wild rice waters. In fact, our very legitimate concern for new sulfate loadings to wild rice resources in the ceded territories originates with documented impacts from existing hard rock (ferrous) mining and patently inadequate regulatory oversight to protect this significant cultural and subsistence resource.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 152
Nancy Schuldt,"The Band has consistently challenged the conclusion that the NorthMet Project will not result in damage to wild rice waters in the Partridge and Embarrass Rivers and their watersheds. Our skepticism arises from growing knowledge of the extent to which state and federal regulatory agencies have consistently failed to enforce standards and regulations on the mining industry that are intended to protect wild rice. We have exhaustively commented on the specific threats of this Project from the very beginning of our involvement as a cooperating agency, and our previous concerns are carried forward to the FEIS, despite the inclusion of engineering controls and water treatment. It is commendable that PolyMet has committed to constructing wastewater treatment plants that include reverse osmosis, which has the potential to meet the low sulfate effluent limit if designed and operated properly, including at the Mine Site at year 1. But the damage to wild rice will be just as real and just as permanent if it results from inadequate regulatory controls, as if it results from inadequate engineering controls.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS COOP Response #19684
Nancy Schuldt,"Minnesota tribes have engaged in consultation with the MPCA on this culturally vital issue and provided recommendations for better protection of the wild rice that remains across a much-diminished range. The tribal cooperating agencies have engaged in consultation with the federal Co-lead agencies under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, continually elevating the need for protection of all remaining wild rice in the 1854 Ceded Territory. During consultation the Bands have provided information about tribal wild rice harvest in the Embarrass River far upstream of where the MPCA has recommended as ‘waters used for the production of wild rice’. The wild rice sulfate standard must apply throughout the Embarrass River watershed. The scant remaining stands in the upper reaches have already been severely impacted by previous mining disturbances and continued releases of high-sulfate water, and are in need of restoration.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Nancy Schuldt,"This contorted interpretation of ‘compliance’ under the Clean Water Act is not defensible. The NorthMet Project Proposed Action must meet MN WQS, including the sulfate criterion to protect wild rice. The FEIS fails to acknowledge that under the Clean Water Act, the state of Minnesota is required to bring impaired waters into compliance through TMDLs and other watershed restoration actions. The existing LTVSMC tailings basin, along with other inactive mine features, is clearly causing an exceedance of the wild rice sulfate criterion and has led to the decline in stand density and productivity within the watershed. The CEC scenario is not representative of the state’s CWA obligations to restore impaired beneficial uses. As stated previously, our concerns for protecting wild rice within this region of the 1854 Ceded Territory is based as much upon inadequate implementation of MN WQS protections, as upon the high likelihood that surface and groundwater discharges from the Project will exceed MN WQS.

Fond du Lac’s comments on the DEIS regarding the existing wildlife corridors are still applicable: they are fundamentally inadequate to maintain habitat connectivity across the heavily disturbed Mesabi Iron Range. As evidenced from aerial photographs, they’re narrow and often heavily intruded upon by roads, utility corridors, mine pits and urban development.

Increased urban development and associated transportation and utility infrastructure should be expected if the Project provides even a fraction of the economic benefits claimed in the FEIS. Yet there is no minimization or mitigation proposed or even evaluated in the FEIS for this significant environmental impact.

The ESA §7 consultation process is intended to determine jeopardy (likelihood of a species’ extinction from the Proposed Action) and address mitigation for impacts to endangered species. The ESA §7 process would not address mitigation measures for other species which are not presently endangered but which would be adversely affected by the loss of wildlife corridors. Again, the only reasonable process for fully evaluating likely impacts and then identifying and requiring mitigating actions is through the EIS and then with a fair examination of the impacts and mitigation measures in the EIS, implemented through the MnDNR Permit to Mine. The FEIS here fails to address an important issue, incorrectly leaves it to a process that will not address it, and deprives the public and the MnDNR of the information it should have to address this issue.",WI,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WI 03
Nancy Schuldt,"But, from the Band’s perspective, perhaps the most significant deficiency in the FEIS analysis of wildlife impacts is its failure to critically analyze potential impacts to moose. As to moose, the FEIS states: The moose (Alces americanus) is not federally listed, but was added to the Minnesota ETSC species list as a species of special concern in 2013. Moose, which have been observed in the NorthMet Project area (ENSR 2005), are a species of specific importance to the Bands...The overall moose population in Minnesota declined approximately 35% from 2012 to 2013 (MDNR 2013d). The 2014 winter aerial moose survey estimated the population at 4.350 animals, up from the 2013 estimate of 2,760 (DelGiudice 2014). However, this is likely due to variability in the survey conditions from year to year and uncertainty inherent in the survey itself...Due to decreased population levels in the state of Minnesota and its new state listing as a species of special concerns, the moose hunting season was closed in 2013 and not reopened. In previous years, when moose hunting was open, the NorthMet Project area would have been outside of the hunting zone, though moose zone 30 is located to the south of the Transportation and Utility Corridor. In 2012, two moose were harvested in zone 30 (DelGiudice 2012). The tribal cooperating agencies have consistently raised impacts to moose as an issue of critical importance throughout the DEIS, SDEIS, Section 106 consultation, and ‘sieve list’ meeting processes. We have valid concerns about the Project’s impact on moose habitat at a time when their population is crashing, and they should be addressed immediately. Tribal wildlife biologists have been working alongside DNR biologists and academic researchers to try to understand the relevant factors. Hunting pressure has been ruled out as a major contributing factor to population-level declines, but the appearance of holding a hunt does not sit well with the public, so the DNR, 1854 Treaty Authority and Fond du Lac have all closed their respective moose seasons since 2013. However, the Band’s concern for Project impacts to moose is not simply potential effects to hunting zones and seasons; we are gravely concerned about protecting sustainable moose populations for future generations. In considering the potential causes of the moose population decline, wildlife biologists recognize the importance of thermal refuge for moose when temperatures exceed 70o F.126 Undisturbed, high-quality wetlands and forests - essentially all of the landscape that will be destroyed at the mine site – represent the type of habitat that serves as thermal refuge, along with shelter and forage.",WI,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WI 01
Nancy Schuldt,"Notwithstanding EPA’s recommendation, the FEIS includes no discussion of means by which the adverse impacts on moose might be avoided or mitigated. Instead, the response to the recommendation was the boilerplate statement ascribed to most of the substantive comments provided by cooperating agencies on the PFEIS: “The information and analysis as offered in the PFEIS is sufficient and appropriate for purposes of environmental review.” This disposition by the Co-lead agencies of a critical deficiency in the EIS process is indefensible.",NEPA,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme NEPA 08
Nancy Schuldt,"The FEIS presentation of existing conditions for aquatic communities (fish and macroinvertebrates) is deficient and potentially misleading.128 The Co-lead agencies neglected to include and consider substantial readily available biological and water quality data from the MPCA, no less, which characterizes aquatic life use impairments in several streams and rivers within the NorthMet Project area, namely the Embarrass River, Wyman Creek, and Spring Mine Creek. The intensive watershed monitoring done in 2009-2010 within the St. Louis River Watershed also included substantial physical, chemical and biological data for many other stream and river stations within the Project area, and the Stressor ID Report for the waters in the St. Louis River watershed that were assessed as ‘impaired’ also includes a list of the stream and river stations that were used to develop summary statistics and establish ‘reference condition’ for this watershed. The Band’s comments on this matter in the 2009 DEIS pointed out the limitations of relying solely upon PolyMet-collected data to base predictions of Project impacts, and that criticism is still relevant. By only presenting their evaluation of biological community condition within the limited universe of data collected by the Project Proponent, the Co-lead agencies deliberately neglect to provide important context to the public about actual baseline or reference condition and existing impairments for fish and benthic macroinvertebrate communities that are largely the result of existing mining impacts.

Nancy Schuldt,"Lake sturgeon have been successfully reproducing in the estuary for several years, and Fond du Lac Resource Management Division’s successful reintroduction and tracking efforts in the upper river have been documented.130 After the construction of hydroelectric facilities on the St. Louis River in the early 1900’s, the lake sturgeon population in the upper St. Louis River was isolated from the lower estuary and Lake Superior. The remaining sturgeon population was likely extirpated due to exploitation and pollution from the wood products industry and municipal waste. In addition, many of the upper tributaries were dammed during the extensive white pine logging era (1800’s) in order to float logs down during the high water spring runoff. Pollution and degraded water quality has been identified as a factor limiting sturgeon abundance in many locations. 132 The conclusion at FEIS 4-275 that “There are no known occurrences of lake sturgeon and not likely habitat for lake sturgeon within the NorthMet Project area” neglects to consider that downstream water quality effects may result from the Proposed Project. This water quality effect is specifically what the Band expected to see addressed in the FEIS, as it represents yet another potential degradation of our downstream water quality that is explicitly relevant to our stated resource management goals for name, or lake sturgeon. A dramatic recovery in lake sturgeon abundance in Rainy River and Lake of the Woods followed improvements in water quality in the Rainy River, which resulted from substantial reductions in the amount of wood fiber and untreated chemical wastes discharged by upstream pulp and paper mills. Evidence from hatchery rearing studies show that juvenile sturgeon can only tolerate salinity < 23 ppt.134 The Band is concerned about protecting the both the habitat and water quality necessary to support our reintroduction efforts.

While secondary ambient air quality standards do exist for vegetation, these are not to be used for deposition. “Deposition” is a concentration of a pollutant that settles out of the air onto a surface.

Nancy Schuldt,"The FEIS states on page 5-310 that modeled annual dust deposition rates were compared to an “annual effects-level deposition rate” (background) of 365 g/m2/yr. Apparently this “annual effects-level deposition rate” is a potential effects threshold for photosynthesis due to “dusting” of the plant’s surface. However, direct physical effects of mineral dusts on vegetation can be seen at a surface load of 7 g/m2 and chemical effects of reactive materials can be seen at 2 g/m2 136. These levels indicate that the proposed “impact” level of 365 g/m2/yr is too high. Further, as the Band commented on both the PSDEIS and the SDEIS, the modeled deposition rates only look at impacts to photosynthesis due to blocking sunlight from the plants’ leaves, they do not include the effects of contamination from metals, nor contamination from other sources, such as pit leaks and seepage, nor are cumulative impacts from all of these sources included in Chapter 6. The Class I Deposition Analysis Threshold set by Federal Land Managers for both nitrogen and sulfur deposition in the eastern half of the US (including Minnesota) is 0.01 kg/ha/yr. If one takes the effects level threshold discussed on page 5-310 of the FEIS (365 g/m2/yr) and converts it to similar units (assuming the dust is 0.12% sulfur), the threshold level proposed as adequate for the area is 438 kg/ha/yr, or 43,800 times the amount of sulfur deposition that is allowed in a Class I area.

Nancy Schuldt,"Further, the FEIS confuses the results from PolyMet 2015b and PolyMet 2015q. The FEIS statement: “An estimate of the spillage of ore fines along the rail corridor is provided in Section 8.4.3 of the Waste Characterization Data Package (PolyMet 2015q). Assuming that all spillage of the coarse material would occur in a 2-meter-wide strip on both sides of the centerline of the railway (total width equals 4 meters) over the entire haul distance after loading (approximately 8 miles or 13,000 meters), results in approximately 0.11 kilograms per square meter (kg/m2) of ore fines annually or 2.14 kg/m2 for the 20- year NorthMet Project Proposed Action. This equates to 0.002 inch of depth annually or 0.05 inches for the 20-year NorthMet Project Proposed Action” 137 is incorrect because these results actually came from PolyMet 2015b. What PolyMet 2015q finds is different. See PolyMet 2015q, Section 8.4.3 - “Assuming that all spillage occurs in a 2 meter wide strip along this portion of the rail corridor, it is estimated that approximately 2.78 kg/m2 could spill annually or 55.7 kg/m2 over the life of the Project. This is equivalent to 1.25 inches of spilled material over a 2,000 m2 area”. The FEIS also leaves out any mention of the 55.7 kg/m2 value. Additionally, the FEIS (page 5-164) states that the spilled material would become rapidly depleted of sulfide materials compared to the waste rock stockpiles. This statement offers nothing in the way of quantification of the amount of sulfide that would be released, nor does it address the metals that would also leach from the material. As mentioned above, PolyMet 2015q predicts that metals concentrations have the potential to exceed water quality standards for four metals: aluminum, cobalt, copper, and nickel. On the basis of this and the above arguments, the Band believes that the FEIS does not adequately address this topic. The FEIS discusses refurbishment of existing ore cars that would reduce spillage by 97%, to 0.20 tons per year. (PolyMet 2014a)”. The Band proposes that this modification requirement be incorporated into the final permit for the facility. The FEIS states that most of the potential spillage from the rail cars will occur within the first 1,000 meters of rail from the Rail Transfer Hopper (page 5-164). The Band disagrees with this assessment. “The Fugitive Dust Risk Management Plan (FDRMP) for Red Dog Operations, Alaska (August 2008, draft) states: “Elevated metal concentrations have been identified in tundra in areas surrounding the DMTS, primarily as a result of deposition of fugitive dust originating from the DMTS corridor, which is used to transport zinc and lead ore concentrates from the Red Dog Mine, operated by Teck Cominco Alaska Incorporated (Teck Cominco)”.

Nancy Schuldt,"The SDEIS stated that the Biwabik Iron Formation (which has been found to contain amphibole fibers) slopes under the Duluth Complex at the Mine Site, coming within 100 feet of the area that the company plans to mine. The Band’s previous comments regarding unexamined hydrological connections between geologic layers or formations are also applicable in this instance. With fractured bedrock present, that could establish a hydrological connection, and 100 feet would be an insufficient barrier. Additionally, these types of formations are characteristically not homogeneously distributed, meaning that pockets of fibers could be found unexpectedly. While it is true that some information on the occurrence of amphibole fibers has been gathered from the site, the drill locations were chosen with regard to studying minerals of economic interest, and did not specifically target locations where fibers may be expected to occur.

That is why modern landfills cannot be sited as proposed for the NorthMet Project; federal standards or equivalent state standards must be met. Minnesota statutes preclude the siting of a hazardous waste or solid waste facility in a wetland or in a location where the topography, geology, hydrology or soil is unsuitable for the protection of the ground water or surface water.

And as presented in the FEIS, there are two new sources of contaminants planned for disposal in the HRF: water treatment plant solids (primarily gypsum), and coal ash wastes from the existing LTVSMC site Coal Ash Landfill, one of the previously identified AOCs subject to the Consent Decree. These new, potentially toxic and reactive wastes may represent up to 10% of the HRF solids volume155, yet there is no characterization of the mass or concentration of chemicals resulting from the co-disposal of these wastes with the Hydrometallurgical process wastes.

While the FEIS maintains that the Crandon method is used in the assessment of indirect wetland impacts for the NorthMet Proposed Project, it clearly has not been used. The Crandon method relies upon a detailed delineation of wetlands leading to accurate wetland classifications, and an accurate characterization of groundwater hydrology supported by a calibrated groundwater model.

Nancy Schuldt,"But the FEIS analyzed the impact of the Project on the Bands’ treaty rights under an improper test which it then applied in a manner that is contrary to the record. The FEIS states that because of the limited accessibility to the Project area, “there is likely limited present day or recent past subsistence gathering in the NorthMet Project area” and concludes that the proposed Project is therefore “unlikely to further diminish the exercise of 1854 treaty rights in the area.” FEIS 5-569; see also FEIS at 5-572 (imposing this standard). The law says otherwise. Under well-settled law, denial of access to an area where treaty rights are reserved does not “diminish” the treaty-reserved rights. See Winans, 198 U.S. at 381 (rejecting claims by a landowner who obtained a license to use a ‘fish wheel’ – a device capable of catching salmon by the ton and totally destroying a run of fish – of a right to exclude the Indians from their treaty-reserved “usual and accustomed” fishing areas); see also Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Ass'n, 443 U.S. at 684-85 (“property law concepts, devices such as the fish wheel, license fees, or general regulations” cannot be used to deprive the Indians of a fair share of the fish). Further, under the law, it is enough that the rights are reserved in the treaty to be entitled to protection. The notion, expressed in the FEIS, that the tribes somehow were required to prove “present day or recent past”178 hunting, fishing or gathering activities on specific portions of the Project site in order to ensure that the natural resources on which the right depends are protected, is entirely without basis in the law.",CR,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme CR 01

As set out in detail in the comments provided by the Bois Forte Band, the oral testimony provided by Band members described the use of this area for gathering and hunting. Latady & Isham 2011. There is no dispute that the Spring Mine Lake Sugarbush lies within the area of potential effect of the proposed mine, and encompasses 80 acres of maple and basswood trees which may be up to 200 years old and have well documented evidence of Chippewa use for maple sugar making over an extensive period of time, including photographic evidence of Chippewa use in the 1940s.

This Trail is a major Chippewa trail (one of many) within a system of water and overland routes that crisscrossed northeastern Minnesota and extended to the border lakes long before the fur trade and continued to be used through the early 20th century. The FEIS recognizes that this trail is eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, FEIS at 5-560, and “is significant for the role it played in the broad patterns of Ojibwe land use . . .” but “would be directly affected by the NorthMet Project Proposed Action, which would result in its permanent removal.” FEIS at 5-565.

The land within the Project area serves as a vital habitat for a wide variety of resources. The land is an important wildlife corridor in a region that has otherwise been the subject of extensive iron ore mining. The history of mining in the region and the adverse environmental impacts from those mines have steadily reduced the Chippewas’ access to critical resources from the natural environment which only serves to make these remaining areas – as well as the resources they contain – all the more valuable.

The FEIS improperly assumes that because 7,075 acres of land will be provided to replace the 6,495 acres of land that would be exchanged, that the Band’s treaty rights are enhanced simply by virtue of the increase in net acres of land that will be administered by the Forest Service. FEIS 5-672. But a comparison of acreage, without consideration of the functional value of the lands that would be lost, is fundamentally flawed. The lands to be exchanged include 6,025 acres that have been designated by Minnesota as Sites of High Biodiversity Significance. FEIS 5-701. The ecological term ‘biodiversity’ equates to ‘abundance’ and ‘subsistence’ for the Bands. Of these, nearly 2,000 acres of coniferous bog wetlands will be lost to the federal estate and therefore effectively to the Bands, if the Land Exchange Proposed Action is implemented.

The FEIS further recognizes that moose and their sign (tracks, droppings, browsing evidence etc”) have been observed at the site. FEIS 5-439.

In sum, while the lands to be provided may increase total acreage of Forest Service lands, those lands will not provide the critical habitat – either now or possibly even in the future -- on which important and unique plants, fish and game depend. The exchange of thousands of acres of high quality wetlands and forests containing some of the few remaining wildlife corridors in northeastern Minnesota available to the Bands to exercise reserved 1854 treaty rights for lands that have moderate diversity is inconsistent with fiduciary responsibilities that are shared by all federal agencies.

Mercury contamination in these waters is of grave concern to Band members, who fish in them. The increasing methylmercury bioavailability in these watersheds is unacceptable because access to fish that can be safely consumed is an essential component of treaty resource harvest rights. The Band is equally concerned about the impact of increased sulfide levels on the viability of wild rice.

Nancy Schuldt,"The FEIS here does not contain a proper analysis of the environmental justice impacts of the proposed mine as is required by Executive Order 12898 and the CEQ Environmental Justice Guidance. The Project here is not one intended to serve broad public interests or needs. It is not a reservoir that would provide stable public water supply, nor a public work needed to address flood control. It is a mine which is sought by a privately-owned company and intended, first and foremost, to generate profits for that company. While the Project may create jobs and generate tax revenues, those are the only potential benefits which may inure to the public (and may well be negated by the potential adverse environmental impacts of the Project). The FEIS otherwise gives no meaningful consideration to the disproportionate impact that the Project would have on Indian people as is required by Executive Order 12898. Contrary to the CEQ Guidance, the FEIS, focuses on a simple recitation of census numbers and proportions of Native Americans in the regional and statewide populations. FEIS 5-590.

FEIS 5-778 - 5-779. But for the reasons discussed above, the land to be exchanged does not mitigate the loss of these critical resources or their adverse impact on the exercise of the treaty rights. More fundamentally, the proposed land exchange does nothing whatsoever to mitigate the disproportionate adverse effects on Indians who depend heavily on fish and wild rice from exposure to mercury and arsenic. The FEIS simply dismisses these concerns, commenting that “bioaccumulation of mercury in fish could affect Band members’ willingness to rely on subsistence fishing as a contribution to household economies, as well as affect continuation of traditional fishing practices.” FEIS 5-573.

Nancy Schuldt,"A proper climate change analysis for this proposed Project would illustrate the adverse impact that the loss of wetlands will have on climate change. In addition to the broadly recognized services that wetlands provide, they also store significant amounts of carbon. It has been estimated that wetlands (only about 6% of the world’s terrestrial area) contain carbon equal to the total atmospheric carbon store (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Working Group 11: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, 5.8.1 (2001)). Much of the carbon stored in wetland soils and vegetation will be released if they are drained, and the release of carbon will exceed sequestration. Yet despite elevating this issue repeatedly to the Co-lead agencies over the course of this environmental review process, the FEIS “analysis” of climate change impacts – all three paragraphs – fails to seriously evaluate Project impacts.198 It gives a brief recitation of recent rulemaking on greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and then simply provides an estimate of Project direct and indirect GHG emissions. As with mercury, the FEIS claims: ...there are no analytical or modeling tools to reliably evaluate the incremental impact of a proposed action’s discrete GHG emissions on the global and regional climate. In addition there are not analytical or modeling tools to reliably evaluate any cascading effects, or cumulative effects, from a particular proposed action’s GHG emissions on natural ecosystems and human economic systems in a given state or region.199 This claim is particularly galling, in light of the St. Louis River ecosystem services valuation study that the Band provided to the Co-lead agencies in June, which they chose to disregard. The study explicitly analyzed the carbon sequestration capacity for the land cover classes that were evaluated for the study, including forests and various wetland types. The headwaters region of the watershed is essentially a large peatland complex, representing a vast carbon sink; loss of peatlands equals a loss of an enormous sink in the region and the release of carbon to the atmosphere. Peatlands contain greater than 3X more carbon per hectare than other ecosystems,200 and this important function (carbon storage) is so critical that its value is calculated separately from the other ecosystem services in the asset valuation. For the St. Louis River watershed, the carbon storage alone is valued between $56 billion and $95 billion201.

The Co- lead agencies eliminated this alternative from further evaluation because it would have had “a significantly reduced rate of operation that would not be considered economically feasible, and, therefore, would not meet the Purpose and Need of the Project.” Tribal cooperating agencies urged the Co-lead agencies, now including the US Forest Service (USFS), to do a more robust analysis of the underground mining alternative for the SDEIS, but the Colead agencies did not “exercise a degree of skepticism in dealing with self-serving statements from the prime beneficiary of a Project.” when analyzing this alternative. This alternative was eliminated by the Project proponent based purely on an economic decision that underground mining would not be as profitable as open pit mining. The Co-lead agencies claim that “it was not possible to undertake a quantitative, side-by-side assessment of the underground mining alternative.” An underground mine would have a reduced mining rate and life of mine, employed fewer workers for a shorter period of time, and reduced state and local tax revenues. Although the underground mining alternative would offer substantial environmental benefits (significantly less wetland destruction, less mine-generated waste, less groundwater and surface water pollution generated and requiring perpetual treatment and control, less reclamation and closure activities, less nuisance and reactive dust to be controlled, less noise and vibration impacts, less visual impacts), the economic and intrinsic value of those benefits are not even estimated. In addition, an underground mine Project would not require a federal land exchange, resulting in lower start-up costs and avoiding the permanent loss of high quality resources (as discussed in later comments on Land Exchange impacts). Based upon an incomplete analysis of the benefits of an underground mine, the Co-lead agencies determined that this alternative would result in reduced socioeconomic benefits, and; “PolyMet would not move forward with an unprofitable Project, thus any potential environmental or socioeconomic benefits associated with this alternative are moot.”",ALT,S,O,2,SDEIS COOP Response #19584

An underground mining Project would leave most of the NorthMet Deposit unmined because of its low metal value relative to the cost of mining and mineral processing. Other material would have to be left in place for safety reasons, to prevent collapse.”248 Therefore, “the Co-lead Agencies found that while underground mining is technically feasible, available, and would offer significant environmental benefits over the proposed NorthMet Project, it would not be economically feasible and would not meet the Purpose and Need. Since the underground mining alternative would not meet all of the screening criteria, it is not considered to be a reasonable alternative. Therefore, the underground mining alternative was eliminated from further evaluation in the SDEIS.”249 The SDEIS did not contain the appropriate level of detail required to eliminate this alternative.

This is not the appropriate rigor in a cost-benefit analysis for thoroughly evaluating an EIS alternative.

Nancy Schuldt,"Inexplicably, the FEIS removes from Chapter 4, Affected Environment, this salient description of existing land use in the federal tract that appeared in the SDEIS: The federal lands proposed for exchange contain portions of the Minnesota County Biological Survey (MCBS) Headswater Site. “The Headwaters Site straddles the continental divide, with water from the Site flowing both east through the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and north to the Arctic Ocean. Paradoxically, the divide runs through a peatland. Although the peatland appears flat, water flows out of it from all sides, forming the ultimate source of rivers that eventually reach two different oceans. The Site is the headwaters of four rivers: Stony River, Dunka River, South Branch Partridge River, and the St. Louis River, which is the second largest tributary to Lake Superior....[t]hese conservation areas are the best opportunities for conserving the full diversity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and globally rare or declining species.” It is hard to understand why, in the face of explicit SDEIS narrative noting the biodiversity significance of the Mine Site in its current condition and land use, the Co-lead Agencies would expunge this information from the FEIS. It does not serve the public, nor comport with federal trust responsibility, to deliberately diminish the ecological values provided by such a large expanse of intact, functional, diverse forest and wetland habitat.",VEG,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme VEG 03

The Band questions, more importantly, the statement “...federal lands are not accessible to the public for economically measurable use, such as forestry or recreation...Thus while the federal lands may hold some theoretical economic value for timber harvest, their practical economic value is zero.""

As discussed above, although required by the Council on Environmental Quality,276 as well as the Office of Management and Budget, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the FEIS provisions on the proposed land exchange wholly fail to consider, much less address, the value of ecosystem services.

Id. at 1-5. The record includes an economic analysis of the ecosystem service value of the St Louis Watershed. Fond du Lac submitted an expert economist report, The Value of Nature's Benefits in the St. Louis River Watershed278 to the Co- lead Agencies with the expectation of its consideration in the environmental review (and its inclusion in Appendix C of the FEIS), and GLIFWC provided additional preliminary analysis of the value of the wetlands/floodplains/forests for properties conveyed.

The Land Exchange Proposed Action would relinquish water resources within the Lake Superior basin for wetlands and surface water resources outside the Lake Superior basin and the St. Louis River watershed, although still within the 1854 Ceded Territory. Federal lands include 4,164 acres of wetlands within the Lake Superior basin; non-federal lands contain 4,669 acres of wetlands, of which only 373 acres are within the Lake Superior Basin, demonstrating there would be a permanent loss of 3,791 acres of federally managed wetlands within the Lake Superior Basin.286 It is well known that wetlands play an important role in protecting the quality and condition of downstream waters by retaining floodwaters, sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants.

Wendy Robertson,"The FEIS fails to include the value of the natural capital of the St. Louis Watershed when mitigating the wetlands for the Polymet Project. Natural capital is defined as “minerals, energy, plants, animals, ecosystems, (climatic processes, nutrient cycles and other natural structures and systems) found on Earth that provide a flow of natural good and services” (Daly and Farley, 2004). Two of the three mitigation sites for this project are not in the watershed thus result in a loss to the St. Louis Watershed area. In June 2015, a study was commissioned by the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. The band and the U.S. EPA. provided the funding for the study, “The Value of Nature’s Benefits in the St. Louis River Watershed”, which was completed by a team employed by Earth Economics, Tacoma, WA. Their findings were published in a 105 page report that may be reproduced for educational and non-commercial use without prior copyright permission from the holder provided the source is acknowledged. I have used some of their data to defend my comments. In the valuation results from this study, the total land cover of the St Louis watershed area is 2,376,286 acres. It provides between $5 billion and $13.7 billion (low and high figures) in benefits each year to people. The numbers indicate investment in natural capital that supports an ecosystem of services and benefits. An example would be in carbon sequestration from the extensive acreage of peatland. Peatlands hold three times as much carbon as other ecosystems. From recreation and tourism, this area is valued at $12,843.00 per acre. Local businesses benefit from this value. The proposed mitigation plan falls short in the FEIS for three reasons: one, all the mitigation is not within the St. Louis watershed, two, there is no determination by the state and federal agencies on the drainage status of the bog restoration sites (compensatory mitigation) from active sod farms and agricultural production, and three, the USACE has not made a final decision on the mitigation ratios that would be required to compensate for direct wetland impacts. To date about $750,000,000.00 has been spent to clean-up from the industrial pollution disaster of the St. Louis River watershed area. It is still unsafe for certain human populations to consume fish from the river without heeding the MN Dept. of Health’s warning guidelines. It is still considered an endangered river without the additional impact of sulfide mining. The amount of short-term proposed economic gains or benefits from the Polymet project in comparison with the costs of jeopardizing the long-term environmental economic value of the St. Louis River watershed should not be given any more consideration. Therefore, I am against the MNDNR giving the NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange project a green light. I’m asking them to state, “No Alternative Action”, in their decision on the FEIS. I am also asking the USACE not to issue any 404 permits to the Polymet project. The USAD Forest Dept. should not agree to any land exchange.

Given that the 100 Mile Swamp is the most extensive wetland feature in the area, it seems unlikely that the co-leads contention, above, would be correct. nan",WAT,S,N,12,"DNR acknowledges the Mine Site modeling was designed to evaluate the issues identified in EIS scoping. Modeling was required to estimate potential pit inflows in Final SDD Section 6.3. For the purposes of meeting this EIS scoping requirement, it was not necessary to characterize the vertical hydraulic conductivity for wetlands and surficial deposits at the 100 Mile Swamp beyond the data already obtained. It was also not necessary to precisely determine the downward recharge flux from the 100 Mile Swamp into the bedrock groundwater system north of the Mine Site. Rather, the Mine Site MODFLOW model relied on data collected from other parts of the site that were generalized to the north in the model assumptions, including the 100 Mile Swamp. The values used for representing wetland soils in the modeling have no bearing on the impact assessment for wetlands"
john.coleman,"The co-leads seem to overlook the fact that the PolyMet east pit inflow is coming from the north side of the project. If the project data was adequate for looking at water movement toward the east pit from the north, it should be adequate to look at flow from the east pit going to the north.",WAT,S,N,12,"DNR does not challenge that there is northward groundwater flow in bedrock in the Mine Site MODFLOW model if Northshore Mine pit lake elevations are lower than the proposed NorthMet pits in closure. DNR asserts that these results are unreliable for use as the basis for assessing any impacts associated with closing the NorthMet Mine. The model is not designed to predict the potential interaction of the NorthMet Mine Site with future operations of the Northshore Mine and its westernmost pits. If this was feasible and a requirement of the EIS, far greater emphasis would be placed on assessing the hydrogeology of the surficial and bedrock units than is available with the current NorthMet Mine Site model. Integrating assumptions on the potential staging of future Northshore operations into the model would also be necessary. DNR’s concession that northward flow between the NorthMet Mine and Northshore Mine is possible is not based on modeling If the existence of a northward flow path was possible, it would be happening now. There is no potential for northward flow until mining in the Northshore pits results in water levels (at Northshore) below the water levels of the proposed NorthMet pits. When and if this might occur is not precisely known, but it is most likely to occur after the proposed NorthMet Mine East Pit (of particular interest) has been reclaimed in mine year 20. DNR asserts that any such phenomena can be detected, and if detected, it can be prevented."
john.coleman,"As the applicant and the co-lead agencies have contended since before 2008 the vertical conductivities under the 100 Mile swamp are likely to be low because of thick wetland soils. As we demonstrate in our comment letter of December 13th, even with higher conductivities than those previously supported by the co-leads, it is impossible for enough leakage to enter the bedrock in this area to support a bedrock groundwater mound adequate to prevent northward flow.",WAT,S,N,12,DNR acknowledges that it cannot rule out that future operations at the Northshore Mine could
john.coleman,"The elevation of the land surface is, among other reasons identified in our December 13th letter, why the hypothetical mound cannot exist. Both Figures 5 and 6 of the co-lead agencies' memo erroneously place the surficial deposits 25-50 feet in the air above the 100 Mile Swamp. Correct elevations for the land surface and bedrock top are shown in attached Figure 2. Analysis based on the bedrock formations, their conductivities, and the elevation of the land surface and bedrock top, does not support the maintenance of an adequate bedrock groundwater mound between the mine projects.",WAT,S,N,8,"MDNR et al, 2015c. DNR acknowledges the surface and bedrock elevations in Figures 5 and 6 could be refined to better reflect site topography. Regardless, the agency acknowledgesthat it cannot rule out that future operations at the Northshore Mine could theoretically induce northward groundwater bedrock flow from the NorthMet Mine Site. See Final EIS Section 6.2.2.3.1. The purpose of Figures 5 and 6 of the interagency memorandum was to illustrate the results of the downward flux scoping calculations. The figures are a reasonable representation of the downward leakage estimates necessary for a groundwater flow divide to be present between the facilities."
john.coleman,"The amount of precipitation is largely irrelevant. The amount of the precipitation that can pass through the surficial deposits to the bedrock is relevant. Unfortunately, neither the co-lead agencies nor their consultant looked at how much water could pass through the surficial deposits. Our analysis, documented in our December 13th letter, demonstrates that there would not be enough leakage to create an adequate mound. nan",WAT,S,N,12,"Although not identified as an issue for assessment in the EIS, DNR considered potential future operations at the Northshore Mine against information that is available. DNR acknowledges that it cannot rule out that future operations at the Northshore Mine could induce northward groundwater bedrock flow from the NorthMet Mine Site. See Final EIS Section 6.2.2.3.1. This might happen if there is insufficient natural downward leakage into bedrock from the overlying wetlands and surficial materials between the proposed NorthMet Mine (in closure) and the Northshore Mine (in future operations and closure). If there is sufficient downward leakage, then there would be groundwater flow divide between the two mines where there is no continuous one-way flow between the facilities. If natural leakage is insufficient to maintain a groundwater flow divide"
john.coleman,"In fact, MODFLOW modeling by GLIFWC indicates that the full Area003 West pit would mostly negate the effect of the dewatered Area003 East pit. Groundwater level trends in the region are also relevant to interpretation of the 5 bedrock wells.

The success of grouting depends on the location and extent of the transmissive features on the north side of the PolyMet pits some of which may occur at great depth. Multiple, diffuse features that transmit water to the north from the pit would require a grout curtain to reduce flow. If northward flow is in both the shallow and deep bedrock, as suggested by our water budget analysis, the grout curtain may have to be vertically continuous to the depth of the east pit. A grout curtain of that extent appears impractical. If northward flow is in discrete fractures or faults, locating those features could be problematic, particularly at depth.",WAT,S,N,8,"MDNR at al, 2015c.

In those project runs of closure conditions, the water levels in the P-M taconite pits were assumed to remain at the level found in 1996. At closure the P-M pits will not be at 1996 levels but over 300 feet lower. In fact those 1996 levels were atypical; they did not occur in the 1980s, do not occur now and will not occur at closure. A plot of water levels in the Area 003-East P-M pit, the pit closest to the PolyMet east pit, show how atypical the mid-1990s water levels were (attached as Figure 5). In the project predictive models of closure conditions, the adjacent taconite pits to the PolyMet project site were set to have a 1996 water elevation of 1616 feet or 493 meters. However, the P-M taconite pit water levels expected at P-M pit closure are 1300 feet or 396 meters. After reflooding of the P-M pits, the water levels in those pits will be maintained by an outfall in the north-east at 1500 feet or 457 meters (see figure from Barr Engineering’s Northshore Watershed Mitigation Plan (FEIS reference Barr 2010e), attached as Figure 1). nan",WAT,S,N,4,"MDNR et al, 2015c. Establishing the Northshore pit lake water level at 1,616 feet above mean sea level as a boundary condition for the Mine Site MODFLOW model was done to meet the requirements of Final SDD Section 6.2.

This approach is also consistent with Final SDD Section 3.3.4, which requires hydrologic modeling to be done to estimate the quantity and timing and outflow from the pit after mining to determine potential treatment needs for reclamation. See MDNR et al, 2015c. The Final SDD did not require assessment of Northshore mining operations beyond potential cumulative impacts associated with: wetlands (Section 3.3.8.7); streamflow (Section 3.3.8.9); water quality (Section 3.3.8.10).

The close proximity of the P-M pits to the Partridge River and PolyMet mine features (attached Figure 6) suggests that the taconite mine pits would impact the hydrology of these features. In fact, runs of the project model indicate that the groundwater flow direction between the PolyMet project and the taconite pits would be reversed if the taconite pits had the correct P-M pit closure water elevation of 396 meters or even the very long-term level of 457 meters.",WAT,S,N,12,"DNR notes the Mine Site MODFLOW model and associated scoping calculations reflect available information between the proposed NorthMet project site and the Northshore Peter Mitchell Mine pits.

If the first model is accepted then wetlands and the upper Partridge River may be little affected by pit dewatering but dewatering of the Peter-Mitchell pits causes a bedrock northward flowpath to develop at closure.

There is no potential for northward flow until mining in the Northshore pits results in water levels (at Northshore) below the water levels of the proposed NorthMet pits. When and if this might occur is not precisely known but it is most likely to occur after the proposed NorthMet Mine East Pit (of particular interest) has been reclaimed in mine year 20. DNR asserts that any such phenomena can be detected, and if detected, it can be prevented."
john.coleman,"A coherent conceptual model needs to be articulated, either the one previously supported by the co-leads in which surface water features are poorly connected to the bedrock aquifer and are therefore, unaffected by pit dewatering, or one in which surface water features are well connected to the bedrock aquifer and can provide abundant leakage to support a groundwater mound between the PolyMet and Peter-Mitchell pits. If the first model is accepted then wetlands and the upper Partridge River may be little affected by pit dewatering but dewatering of the Peter-Mitchell pits causes a bedrock northward flowpath to develop at closure. If the second conceptual model is accepted then a bedrock groundwater mound develops, but wetlands and the upper Partridge River are severely impacted by PolyMet and Peter-Mitchell pit dewatering.",WAT,S,N,12,"The modeling satisfies Final SDD Section 6.2, which required the groundwater flow model to predict inflows at various stages of pit development (i.e., year 1, year 5, year 10, year 20) and include operation, closure, and post-closure. DNR asserts that it is possible to detect and prevent any northward flowpath before any impacts are realized. Final EIS Section 5.2.2.3.6 details specific monitoring requirements, including expansion of the existing system of bedrock groundwater monitoring wells. The goal of the monitoring would be to determine future bedrock flow direction immediately north of the NorthMet pits to identify any need for engineered preventive mitigation measures. Final EIS Section 5.2.2.3.5 identifies known measures that could be applied if a potential for northward flow was detected."

Peatlands hold three times as much carbon as other ecosystems. From recreation and tourism, this area is valued at $12,843.00 per acre. Local businesses benefit from this value. The proposed mitigation plan falls short in the FEIS for three reasons: one, all the mitigation is not within the St. Louis watershed, two, there is no determination by the state and federal agencies on the drainage status of the bog restoration sites (compensatory mitigation) from active sod farms and agricultural production, and three, the USACE has not made a final decision on the mitigation ratios that would be required to compensate for direct wetland impacts.",WET,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WET 03, WET 04, WET 05, WET 15"

I believe that for the EIS, the two processes were tested, but for taconite tailings, not one we know will produce sulfuric acid and which is dramatically different from taconite. My understanding is that the proposed process is a cheaper and more problematic one that has failed in several locations, most notably in northwest Canada. It is inferior to the safer “reverse osmosis” process. Given that we are looking at a clean-up that may last more than two hundred years, long after the mine is closed and probably long after the company or those financially benefitting from the project may themselves be long gone, why should we not demand the more proven albeit more expensive process in order to protect both our environment and our people.",WAT,S,O,2,FEIS Section 5.2.2

Several of these analytes and their molecular variants and compounds are toxic, depending on levels and on receptors. Selenium, particularly, is tremendously dangerous to reproductive mechanisms of amphibians, fish, and water- birds, often at levels found to be beneficial to humans. Animals can’t live with what humans prefer. On the other hand, I observed and, in effect, discovered that a selenium-rich spring, fed from the upgradient Kennecott Refinery, was devoid of nearly all life except hardstem bulrush and Baltic rush. The water was completely clear, showing no invertebrate life, and smelling strongly of selenium compounds. (That spring was diverted to the preferred disposal point nearby on the south shore of the Great Salt Lake, and is now concealed.) Bottom line: selenium is deadly to aquatic ecosystems.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 025
Ivan Weber,"Under the direction of Mr. Cherry and other Kennecott leadership inclined toward simple solutions, however, the subtlety and thoroughness of the sequential ‘separation’ approach to water remediation was discarded in favor of reverse osmosis (RO), an extreme high-pressure filtration technology that produces ‘permeate’ in the form of clean water, and ‘concentrate’ as a dense sludge of contaminant minerals. Pressure is usually required to be around 650-700 pounds per square inch; permeate is typically 65%-75% of the original feed, and concentrate amounts to 25% to 35%. In most general terms, you can predict that concentrate will amount to from 1/4 to 1/3 of the treatment infeed. Although RO appears not to be discussed in the NorthMet submittals, thusfar, that I have seen, this technology must be addressed head-on, because of the sheer volume of ‘concentrate,’ the highly concentrated contaminant load that must be accommodated in the waste disposal strategies of the facility. How concentrated the concentrate actually is, and how much there will be, will obviously be determined by the molecular mass of contaminant chemicals and the rate of flow.",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 128

RO is by far the most likely, partly due to the alignment of key personnel (i.e., PolyMet’s Mr. Cherry) with not only the Kennecott/Rio Tinto experience, but also with other RO applications at other Rio Tinto mines. But you should not take my word for it: Study these cases deeply and honestly, on your own, and draw your own conclusions.

But the more likely sources are in the waste rock and tailings, which are described as being disposed on-site or at site boundaries. The idea that mine management can know when the sulfides are becoming acidic, and respond to modify by adding neutralization compounds, hasn’t worked elsewhere. Why should it work here?",WAT,S,O,3,"SDEIS Themes WR 027, WR 173; SDEIS COOP Response #17812"
Ivan Weber,"1. Oxidation of sulfides takes place not just through direct uptake of oxygen, but rather, through the oxidizing effects of bacteria and bacterial films that prefer sulfide minerals. Everyone seems to be aware of iron-oxidizing bacteria, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, which is an aerobic iron oxidizer. 2. Bacterial species in the genus Desulfovibrio, in the genus Desulfotomaculum are anaerobic sulfate-reducers can actually render selenium to be more toxic to wildlife when deprived of oxygen. The proposed inundation of acid-prone tailings and waste rock can fail, and probably will fail, due to the development of these anaerobic sulfate-reducing communities, such as Desulfovibrio, Desulfotomaculum, or others of the type. “Sub-aqueous disposal” is a bad idea, put bluntly. This is the subject of vigorous debate and investigation, with some very convincing critiques of mines’ discharge into nearby oceans (see Roger Moody’s Into the Unknown Regions: The Hazards of STD” [STD refers to submarine tailings disposal], for example. Nevertheless, like RO ‘treatment,’ it is a fad in the mining industry. nan",WAT,S,N,12,"The comment is noted. Final SDD Section 2.3.1 required the EIS to evaluate in-pit reactive waste rock disposal to retard oxidation of sulfide minerals as a means to in turn reduce the magnitude of long- term treatment of water contacting reactive rock. This action was incorporated into the project design to mitigate potentially adverse effects as originally anticipated in the scoping decision. During operations (Mine year 1-20) the East Pit would be flooded with treated water, precipitation and groundwater and the level of waste rock used as backfill would be above the pit water level elevation"
Ivan Weber,"Dry disposal of tailings offers much better prospects, though northern Minnesota is a difficult challenge for it execution. 4. The old LTV plant does not seem to be the appropriate location for still more degradation. Environmental restoration would appear to be the much better strategy. Instead of perpetuating the description of the former LTV plant as ‘impaired’ or ‘derelict,’ why not make it an industry to restore this place to an acceptable, functional ecological balance? We have dozens of photographs in digital formats of the worst of Kennecott’s acid mine drainage, and some available from the Tar Creek case, but any and all of these cases could be remedied by diligent application of water management, soils management, wetlands design and construction, and responsible wetlands plant community manipulations.

A site specific MODFLOW model that incorporates existing information could provide reasonable estimates of the potentiometric surface (water table). The model could then be stressed by incorporating the proposed PolyMet Mine pits and the neighboring Northshore Mine pits and reasonable estimates of drawdown under the wetlands could be developed. The development of this model, including field data collection to support it, could have been accomplished in far less than the 8 years the EIS process for this project has lasted. Groundwater models, using the MODFLOW software, are standard techniques for assessing groundwater impacts of proposed mines at newly proposed projects across the country. Statements in the FEIS regarding the complexity of the site and the impossibility of successfully modeling water table drawdown cannot be supported. GLIFWC staff disagree with further simplification of the indirect wetland impact analysis. This approach relies on monitoring that by definition would detect impacts after they have already begun to occur. Only then would adaptive management techniques be used to attempt to mitigate the damage. This approach is contrary to the goals of the NEPA process, which is designed to be forward looking.",WET,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WET 08
Esteban Chiriboga,"Mine Site Groundwater Movement. According to the co-lead agency memo of June 22, 2015, it is not possible to rule out a northward bedrock flowpath from the proposed NorthMet pits to the Northshore pits during the closure period and beyond (MODFLOW Teleconference of July 2015 and Draft Interagency Memorandum: Co-Lead Agencies’ Consideration of Possible Mine Site Bedrock Flowpath, June 22, 2015). The results of both complex (MODFLOW) and simplistic (ERM's MathCad) modeling of flow direction indicate that there will in fact be a northward flowpath. The existence of a bedrock groundwater mound that would prevent a northward flowpath, is not plausible given the hydrogeology of the site. Adaptive management cannot be a substitute for understanding the hydrology of a northward flowpath through the development of an analytical model based on site data and a consistent conceptual model. Such an understanding would provide critical information on contaminant flow paths and travel times of contaminants to the north as well as to the Partridge River. The current proposal to have a system of monitoring wells that could detect contaminants moving out of the mine pits is appropriate, but is not a substitute for understanding and predicting the scope of potential impacts. Only with an understanding of the site hydrology and the potential impacts can the feasibility of mitigation measures be evaluated. GLIFWC disagree with this adaptive management approach and maintain that the FEIS is inadequate. A defensible, site specific groundwater model, based on a consistent conceptualization of the site hydrology should be used to characterize site hydrology, understand the effects of the PolyMet project and its interactions with adjacent projects and define contaminant flows.",WAT,S,O,3,MDNR et al. 2015c
Esteban Chiriboga,The analysis conducted in support of the proposed mine is inadequate in that it fails to predict the length of time that water treatment would be required in order to avoid exceedance of water quality standards.,FIN,S,O,8,SDEIS COOP Response #2994
Esteban Chiriboga,"GLIFWC staff agree that the statement above is accurate however we note that it is not very informative. The bottom line is that the FEIS does not predict how long water treatment will be needed for this project. Tribal cooperating agencies and intertribal agencies requested that this analysis be done but the co-lead agencies denied that request. This lack of knowledge has serious implications on financial assurance and the logical feasibility of the project. The notion of water treatment and maintenance for hundreds of years, supported by financial assurance instruments that must also be available for hundreds of years, is difficult to justify.",FIN,NS,X,1,
Esteban Chiriboga,"While the duration of water treatment is unknown, there are many engineered features proposed for this project for which perpetual maintenance is a certainty. These include the water capture and pumpback systems at the flotation tailings basin, the Category 1 stockpile cover system, the hydrometallurgical tailings facility, the overflow control structure at the west pit lake, etc. The FEIS also includes a goal to transition from mechanical water treatment (water treatment plant using reverse osmosis) to non-mechanical methods such as constructed wetlands, permeable reactive barriers, etc. The FEIS does not provide detail on the passive systems, because it states that their effectiveness would have to be demonstrated at a later date. However, it is important to note that passive systems are not maintenance free systems. Available literature indicates that non-mechanical systems require periodic maintenance and replacement. Therefore, the hypothetical transition to a non-mechanical treatment method does not eliminate the need for perpetual maintenance, in fact perpetual maintenance is guaranteed. Minnesota Rule 6132.3200, regarding closures and postclosure maintenance of mines, states that the goal of closure and reclamation is that ""[t]he mining area shall be closed so that it is stable, free of hazards, minimizes hydrologic impacts, minimizes the release of substances that adversely impact other natural resources, and is maintenance free."" Because perpetual maintenance will be required at the hydrometallurgical residue facility, as well as at the numerous engineered features listed above, the project does not appear to meet this goal.",FIN,NS,X,1,
Esteban Chiriboga,"Throughout the FEIS, the co-Lead agencies state that they expect the proposed project to meet all applicable water quality standards. This expectation is based on modeling and GLIFWC does not believe that the modeling is robust enough to support such a statement. However, even assuming that the modeling accurately represents the real future of the project, it is illogical to assume that standards will be met because the modeling assumes effective operation of water capture and treatment facilities in perpetuity. As stated above, the idea that water treatment plants will operate for hundreds of years is not believable. Therefore, the statement that water quality standards will be met is also not believable.",PER,NS,X,1,

It is now recognized that the mine site has been impacted by the Northshore Mine and is not a greenfield site.

Esteban Chiriboga,"The lack of data and lack of understanding of mine site groundwater hydrology is evident in the fatally flawed MODFLOW modeling presented in the FEIS. An adequate characterization of the groundwater system at a proposed mine site is essential to understanding most of the potential impacts from the project. As stated in the GLIFWC letter to the co-lead agencies of August 11, 2015: “The amount of water entering the groundwater system, be it precipitation or discharge from the bed of lakes, rivers or mine pits, determines the direction of flow and dilution of contaminants, and dictates points of compliance for both ground and surface waters. The horizontal and vertical conductivity of the soil and bedrock materials determines how the groundwater system responds to stresses and the rate at which the groundwater flows horizontally and vertically. The character of interaction between surface water features and the groundwater system, whether it is loss of water from rivers or wetlands to the groundwater system, or discharge from the groundwater system to the surface water features, determines predicted impacts to surface water features by stresses such as mine dewatering. Estimating water budgets and quantities of water that must be treated requires an adequate understanding of the groundwater system. None of the above effects of a mine project can be predicted accurately if there is not an adequate characterization of the groundwater system. Without an integrated model of the groundwater system, one would be left with only professional judgment to determine the value of the many interrelated parameters that are used for impact prediction. Professional judgment is useful in checking the reasonableness of the predictions from a groundwater model but, by itself, cannot adequately integrate the complex site specific information, all pieces of which must fit together like a complex puzzle.” MODFLOW is the primary source of information for defining flowpaths of contaminants from the NorthMet Mine pits at closure. The flowpaths are used to define the area of potential effect for cultural resource impact analysis. The flowpaths and the speed of groundwater flow from the MODFLOW model are critical inputs into the GoldSim water quality model. In fact, without MODFLOW results, the GoldSim model could not be run. Thus the outputs generated by GoldSim that predict ultimate water quality parameters in the Partridge River and property boundary points of compliance are not accurate. MODFLOW is fatally flawed for one simple reason. It was calibrated to conditions that did not exist at the same point in time. Water levels in the Northshore taconite pits from 1996 were used along with Partridge River baseflows from 1979- 1988. In addition, the modeling does not incorporate the predicted Northshore pit elevations at closure which would be significantly lower in elevation than the bottom of the NorthMet pits. This approach is contrary to accepted modeling methodology and constitutes an unacceptable calibration error. These concerns were described in detail in comments on the CPDEIS of 2008 emailed to the lead agencies on February 6th, 2009. It is unclear why the lead agencies have failed to correct an error of this magnitude. GLIFWC staff have corrected the calibration error in the applicant’s model. When corrected, the model indicates that the majority of bedrock groundwater flow from the NorthMet pits and Category 1 stockpile will be to the north toward the Northshore Mine pits and not to the south as described in the FEIS. See GLIFWC letters to the co-lead agencies dated August 11 and December 14th for more information. This 180 degree change in flow direction is significant because it invalidates all mine site water resources conclusions in the FEIS regarding water quality at closure. Furthermore, the water quality effects to Birch Lake and the Boundary Waters of Northshore Mine pit water mixing with NorthMet pit effluent have not been evaluated. The co-lead agencies now agree that GLIFWC’s assessment of the MODFLOW model is correct and that the northward flowpath results when the correct water elevations in the Northshore pits are used. However, the co-lead agencies have adopted an idea developed by the applicant to claim that the north flowpath is unlikely. The idea is that a groundwater mound has/would form in bedrock north of the NorthMet Mine pits and would prevent northward flow of pit water through bedrock at closure. This mound cannot form given the hydrogeologic setting of the area. In fact it is physically impossible for a mound to form. See GLIFWC letter of December 14th for additional detail. A webinar and teleconference was scheduled by the co-lead agencies on November 17th, 2015 to discuss the inadequacies of the MODFLOW model and the flawed understanding of mine site hydrology presented in the PFEIS. Since that time, the co-lead agencies have refused to discuss this issue with tribal cooperating agencies and intertribal agencies. In an email dated November 30th, 2015 the co-lead agencies communicated that there would be no additional technical engagement with tribal staff on the topic. GLIFWC staff have attempted to engage in this discussion and continue to provide information to the lead agencies.

Esteban Chiriboga,"The information in the FEIS on Wild Rice is inadequate. GLIFWC staff have submitted comments on the deficiencies in wild rice analysis in every previous version of the FEIS yet the issues remain. We are aware of the MPCA determination on waters that are defined as supporting the production of wild rice. We believe that the process used to inform this determination must incorporate historic information of wild rice presence, abundance and habitat. The following section provides historic information on wild rice that, when viewed in combination with other more recent information, suggests that the Embarrass River produces or has produced wild rice in several areas upstream of the current point of compliance. Therefore, we suggest that the compliance point for the wild rice sulfate standard should be upstream of the current location at all areas where rice is growing. Manoomin or Wild Rice can be found throughout the Great Lakes but the areas of greatest concentration are in Minnesota and Wisconsin (Peter David, GLIFWC wild rice biologist, personal communication, Jenks 1901, Moyle 1944, MRC 1969). The areas of greatest concentration, which are defined as wild rice districts by Jenks, encompass lakes and streams within the region covered by glacial outwash. Jenks’ description of the wild rice district is often cited in other publications that describe the range of wild rice (GLIFWC, 1999). Jenks provides additional information on wild rice distribution by stating that within the wild rice district, rice is found wherever there is suitable habitat. Specifically: “Farther south the St. Louis River system tells the same tale – the streams all bear abundant stores of wild rice” (Jenks, 1901, page 1035) This publication supports the accounts of tribal members from the tribes acting as cooperating agencies for this project. The draft Cultural Landscape Report prepared as part of the Polymet SDEIS dated September 15, 2011 states, “With the potential for wild rice in the shallow margins of lakes and streams, and abundant wild plant, fishing and hunting habitats, portions of the Preliminary Project APE may have been very attractive to the Ojibwe” (pg. 48). That report also includes an account from a Bois Forte tribal member indicating that harvest occurred on the Embarrass River. Another tribal member stated that she knows of a family that harvested wild rice in the vicinity of the LTV tailings dam on the Embarrass River. These specific descriptions would indicate harvest occurring upstream of Embarrass Lake and upstream of Wynne and Sabin Lakes. This supports the notion of abundant wild rice stands in areas where only smaller stands now remain. Another corroborating piece of information is the presence of a wild rice farm straddling the Embarrass River. This wild rice farm operated from 1957 until 1993 when the operation went bankrupt (Barr, 1995). Aerial Photos taken in the spring of 1991 and 1992 show the flooded rice paddies and some ditches connecting the farm to the Embarrass River. The use of water from the river in the farm operation clearly defines the Embarrass River as used for the production of wild rice. In addition Unnamed Creek was likely a source of water for the farm. This creek currently originates at the northwest corner of the LTV tailings basin. According to the Clean Water Act (CWA) this use of water for production of wild rice is a designated use. As such, the sulfate standard applies for the Embarrass River. Field data collected by Barr Engineering (Barr, 2011) indicates that mine related sulfate effluent has already impacted the river to the point of exceeding the wild rice standard. The Draft Staff Recommendation does not provide information on how the MPCA considered the existing water quality in its recommendation and to what extent the high sulfate values have already impacted wild rice on the Embarrass River. This basic analysis should be part of describing existing conditions in the FEIS. A description of how the issues of wild rice habitat protection and existing elevated sulfate levels in the Embarrass River water were treated in the development of the recommendation is needed. Wild rice in this area is a degraded resource. As such, all remnant populations are in need of protection. This need is further emphasized by the designation of the Embarrass River as impaired in the 2012 draft 303d list. The current wild rice standard language clearly states that wildlife use of wild rice is an important factor in protecting the plant. It is not clear how MPCA staff determined that the number of wild rice plants upstream of the current point of compliance is not enough to be used as a food source by wildlife. GLIFWC staff is not aware of research that defines the number of plants or the density of a rice bed that would make it usable to blackbirds, muskrat, geese, or other wildlife. A single plant can provide nutrition to wildlife. Furthermore, browsing by wildlife is one of the reasons that wild rice fluctuates in abundance and density from year to year (Peter David, GLIFWC wild rice biologist, personal communication). The variability that is observed in the wild rice survey data on the Embarrass River may well be the result of wildlife use. Finally, Barr Engineering field notes indicate wildlife is using the wild rice stands in the area. These observations of browsing include small stands that are classified in the lowest density and lowest abundance categories (Barr, 2013). This supports the tribal position that all locations where rice is growing should be points of compliance for the 10 mg/l sulfate standard. Based on available information the GLIFWC staff believes that productive wild rice waters on the Embarrass River are where wild rice is currently growing and is confirmed to have been present in the past. The basis for this view is: • Wild Rice has been present at these locations during at least one of the five survey years (2009 – 2013). • The wild rice sulfate standard is 10 mg/l. • Wild Rice is food for wildlife regardless of its density and the observed inter annual fluctuation in abundance of wild rice in the Embarrass River is consistent with the ecology of wild rice. Barr field notes support this position. • Historic information from tribal sources indicates past harvest in this area and non-tribal sources support the assertion that this is an area where wild rice was found. • The existence of a rice farm in this area is consistent with the assertion that the Embarrass River water quality was supportive to wild rice prior to mining impacts. • Wild rice in the Embarrass River endures despite degraded water quality. It is likely that the degraded water quality has decreased the abundance of wild rice in this river.",WAT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WR 083, WR 152, WR 154. Table 6.2.5-1, Sections 6.2.9.4.3, 6.2.9.4.4.

Chiriboga,"properly characterize indirect impacts to wetlands from hydrologic disruption. This information is based on experience developed in the review of other proposed mines including the proposed Crandon Mine. This is important because the NorthMet FEIS states that the Crandon method is used in the assessment of indirect wetland impacts. Having participated in the development and application of the Crandon method, we can definitively state that the FEIS does not use the Crandon method. The Crandon method of indirect wetland impact assessment relies on two critical pieces of information; a) a detailed delineation of wetlands leading to accurate wetland classifications, and b) an accurate characterization of groundwater hydrology supported by a calibrated groundwater model. Uncertainty in Wetland Delineation. At the mine site, the applicant has delineated wetlands that are within the land proposed for exchange with the Superior National Forest. The delineation work has been reviewed and concerns regarding the accuracy of the delineation have been raised. Field work conducted in September of 2010 by staff from the co-lead agencies, tribal cooperating agencies, intertribal agencies and the consultant for the applicant determined that 25% of the wetlands that were visited were incorrectly classified. All of those wetlands were found to have more connectivity with groundwater (more minerotrophic) than the original classification indicated. Furthermore, the field observations did not definitively rule out groundwater connectivity for a number of wetlands (Eggers, 2015). Following the field review, the applicant conducted additional characterization of wetlands using remote sensing techniques (observations from a helicopter). However, these observations are not appropriate to determine groundwater connectivity in wetlands. The co-Lead agencies did not conduct any additional characterization of wetland – groundwater connections. Monitoring sites have been established in a subset of wetlands, but the data is not used in the analysis of indirect impacts.",,,,,"Sections 6.2.9.4.3, 6.2.9.4.4. MDNR, et al. 2015c.

The co-lead agencies have repeatedly refused to require the applicant to develop a model saying that such a model is too complicated to construct and would not yield useful information. This conclusion is not supportable. Groundwater models are standard requirements of NEPA processes and are routinely developed to provide information on the effects of groundwater drawdown at mines. During the IAP process, tribes, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and technical staff from the MNDNR and MPCA supported the development of a calibrated model.

Esteban Chiriboga,"In lieu of a groundwater model the co-lead agencies decided to use drawdown data from a taconite pit as an analog. This method is flawed for two main reasons. First, the Canisteo pit is located in a different geology and at a different elevation than the NorthMet Mine site. In short, the sites are not analogous. Second, the co-lead agencies used analog data in a selective fashion. They used wells that supported a conclusion that the drawdown in adjacent wetlands would be minor and ignored wells that indicated a substantial effect. To demonstrate this error, GLIFWC conducted an independent indirect wetland analysis for the NorthMet Mine site (Attachment A). The analog data in this analysis was provided by the former MNDNR Mining Hydrologist and ignored by the co-lead agencies. The GLIFWC analysis also used the Crandon method to determine the susceptibility of different wetland types to groundwater drawdown. We submit that the GLIFWC analysis is more defensible from a scientific point of view than the analysis in the FEIS because it uses all available data to establish impact zones and properly assigns impact values based on the Crandon method. One important difference in the analysis of the co-lead agencies and the analysis done by GLIFWC is in the assumption of impacts to ombotrophic and minerotrophic bogs. The co-lead agency analysis assumes that there is a low risk of drawdown impacts to ombotrophic bogs while the GLIFWC analysis assumes that impacts are more likely. The Crandon method did not make the assumption that ombotrophic wetlands have a low risk of impact. It relied on the groundwater model to determine the stress on a wetland and then used the wetland classification to characterize the potential impact. The GLIFWC position is supported by literature and expert analysis. Whittington and Price (2013) describe drawdown impacts to peat bogs in the James Bay lowland of northern Ontario. Dr. Paul Glaser, a recognized authority on peatlands, indicated in his 2014 comments on the SDEIS that “Even if ombotrophic raised bogs are present within the study area, they may still be hydraulically connected to groundwater flow systems and sensitive to impacts from mine development unless they support perched water table mounds (i.e. perched recharge mounds).” Dr. Glaser goes on to say that “no convincing evidence is provided to support their presence.” Finally, even if raised bogs occur at the site, there are a number of publications that report direct connections to groundwater flow systems in the underlying mineral sediments (Siegel and Glaser 1987; Siegel, et al., 1995; Glaser et al., 1990; 1997; 2004ab; 2006). Dr. Glaser states that “[t]hese publications demonstrate that peatland development is dominated by the hydrogeologic setting and not by surface processes.” This conclusion supports GLIFWC’s analysis assumption that wetlands labeled ombotrophic by the co-lead agencies may indeed be impacted by drawdown. Additional support for Dr. Glaser’s conclusions and for the GLIFWC independent wetland analysis is found in the co-lead agency response to public comments on distinguishing between ombotrophic and minerotrophic bogs (Eggers 2015). This document states that “all wetland types within this zone would experience some degree of hydrologic effects due to groundwater drawdown” and supports GLIFWC’s analysis by stating that “the potential for indirect impacts to all bog communities within the 0 to 1000 foot analog zone is acknowledged.” In conclusion, the analysis of indirect wetland impacts in the FEIS is not adequate.

The vast majority of mitigation and/or restoration credits to come from outside the Partridge, Embarrass, and St. Louis River watersheds. There is no justifiable reason to permit out-of-watershed mitigation when in watershed opportunities still exist, especially when the St. Louis River watershed as a whole has experienced cumulative wetland destruction, degradation and hydrologic alterations in well over 50% of the watershed. There is a defined hierarchy for determining the appropriate type and location of wetland mitigation: 1. Credits at a mitigation bank 2. In-lieu fee program credits 3. Permittee-responsible mitigation using a watershed approach 4. Permittee- responsible mitigation through on-site- and in-kind mitigation 5. Permittee-responsible mitigation through off-site and/or out-of-kind mitigation The 2008 Federal Mitigation Rule also states that mitigation sites should be located in within the same watershed as the impact site, and where they are most likely to successfully replace lost functions and services. The Corps is required to “use a watershed approach to establish compensatory mitigation in their permits to the extent appropriate and practicable.” In fact, adhering to the watershed approach in approving compensatory mitigation sites is the only exception to the requirement for in-kind mitigation (§332.3(e)(2)). Although the Corps has some discretion in establishing compensatory mitigation, it must systematically consider options in the prescribed order. And although out-of watershed mitigation can be permitted, its appropriateness is usually considered at the scale of either 8-digit or 6-digit Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUCs). In the case of the NorthMet Proposed Project, PolyMet is proposing that two-thirds of its mitigation will occur outside the major continental drainage divide (see map in Attachment C), within a different 2-digit HUC scale, and based upon the lowest tier of compensatory mitigation types in the hierarchy.",WET,S,O,3,"SDEIS Themes WET 01, WET 03, WET 04"

Esteban Chiriboga,"As detailed in comments submitted to the lead agencies for the 2009 DEIS, the 2014 SDEIS, and the 2015 PFEIS, the water quantity and quality analyses for the Partridge and Embarrass Rivers are inadequate. The results, be they deterministic (DEIS) or in the form of probability distributions (SDEIS), are based on a flawed understanding of hydrology at both mine site and plant site. This flawed understanding, reflected most prominently in the errors in the MODFLOW hydrologic modeling, are carried forward to the GoldSim water quality modeling. The co-lead agencies appear to disregard these problems because there is faith that the seepage capture and treatment systems will work at over 90% effectiveness for centuries. The FEIS claims of long term compliance with applicable water quality standards depend entirely on this leap of faith. On conference calls scheduled to discuss these issues, the lead agency consultants have stated that the effectiveness of the capture systems have not been questioned and the lead agencies have not been able to provide any references that would support their position. We suggest that there are substantial reasons for skepticism regarding capture efficiency for the flotation tailings basin, hydrometallurgical tailings basin, and Category 1 stockpile seepage capture systems. This skepticism is based on available literature and the performance of other facilities in the immediate vicinity. The EPA has conducted an analysis of the effectiveness of seepage capture systems (EPA, 1998). This analysis looked at capture systems at 36 facilities and evaluated their effectiveness based on the performance requirements at each site. It is difficult to extrapolate the results of this analysis to the PolyMet setting because a) the required effectiveness varied from facility to facility; b) the way in which effectiveness was measured was different (i.e. water quality improvements downstream versus change in hydrologic head pressure); and c) data collection varied between facilities. Despite these difficulties, the report indicates that 10% of the reviewed containment systems failed to meet the desired performance objectives and required corrective action. An additional 19% of the evaluated facilities did not have sufficient data to conclude whether the containment system was operating successfully or not. Furthermore, there is no information on the effectiveness of any of these facilities at timeframes remotely comparable to the needs at NorthMet. In the EPA report, long term is considered 30 years whereas the water capture needs at NorthMet are likely perpetual for the flotation tailings basin, Category 1 stockpile and hydrometallurgical tailings basin. Finally, none of the facilities in the study are as large as the one proposed by PolyMet. At the tailings basin, PolyMet has proposed to install a seepage collection system around the north, east, and west sides of the facility. The scale of this engineering control is extensive. It would be approximately 5 miles long and would have to be keyed to bedrock that is 25 to 50 feet below ground surface. The most likely pathway for leakage at this barrier will be in the vicinity of the key with bedrock (EPA, 1998). This feature and the similar containment system at the Category 1 waste rock stockpile are assumed to capture 93% of water leaving the facilities for an indeterminate period of time. As previously stated, there is no scientific justification for this number. The only examples we are able to identify at this time suggest capture rates that are lower. In the Iron Range, GLIFWC staff are aware of two examples that are directly analogous to the proposed PolyMet containment system. These are the seepage collection system at SD026 on the LTV basin itself, and the seepage collection system at the MINTAC tailings basin. SD026. The system is supposed to capture 100% of water leaving the tailings basin and entering Second Creek. The FEIS acknowledges that this water capture system is not operating as effectively as anticipated. Adaptive management is being proposed to augment the effectiveness of the system but no specific methods are identified. MINNTAC. The MINNTAC tailings basin is of similar age and design as the LTV tailings basin that PolyMet proposes to use. Both are large, unlined facilities that are designed to allow water seepage to surface and groundwater in order to maintain structural stability. Both facilities have been discharging thousands of gallons per minute of high sulfate wastewater into the environment for decades. MINNTAC, as part of a schedule of compliance, has begun constructing a seepage capture system that is intended to bring the facility into compliance with applicable water quality standards. The capture system is similar to the one proposed by PolyMet in that it consists of a trench to capture seepage and a system that would pump tailings water back into the facility. The MINNTAC system was originally intended to extend to bedrock but that extension was not possible in some locations because of the presence of large boulders that made construction difficult. Because the geology of the surficial deposits is similar at the LTV facility, it is likely that similar difficulties will be encountered by PolyMet that would decrease capture efficiency. It is important to note that seepage capture of greater than 95% is needed at MINNTAC in order to achieve compliance with applicable water quality standards. However, this high capture efficiency was not considered feasible and MINNTAC predicted that their capture efficiencies would not exceed 60% (US Steel Corp., 2007). Actual performance of the capture system is below 50%. Ultimately, the main purpose of the system is to comply with water quality standards. The capture system will not be able to achieve that goal. Because MINNTAC is the only facility that is analogous to the LTV basin, there are serious doubts about the predicted 90% or greater capture efficiency used in the PolyMet FEIS. The prediction of water quality standard compliance for this proposed project hinges on the perfect operation of the water capture systems. The reliance on this engineered containment system that uses overly optimistic capture rates and must function in perpetuity is not scientifically supported and therefore is not appropriate for the FEIS.",WET,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WR 018, WR 019, WR 020"
Esteban,The assessment of mercury and methylmercury impacts that would result from the proposed NorthMet project is not,MERC,S,O,3,"SDEIS Themes MERC 01, MERC 22, COE 03; MDO #2;"
Chiriboga,"adequate. Cooperating tribes and intertribal agencies have raised mercury and methylmercury as concerns since the pre- draft environmental impact statement review of 2008. Methylmercury is a bioaccumulative neurotoxin that disproportionately impacts tribal populations that depend on fish for a subsistence diet. While the FEIS mentions this issue, the co-lead agencies have refused requests to properly characterize the additional influx of methylmercury to the St. Louis River as a result of wetland and saturated overburden excavations at the mine site. Predicted mercury loadings as a result of the NorthMet Project continue to constitute a Major Difference of Opinion (MDO) between the Co-lead and Tribal Cooperating Agencies. Again, the co-lead agencies have not been receptive to tribal input and thus the issue remains. The FEIS states that, based on mercury mass balance analyses, the NorthMet Project would result in a net increase in mercury loadings to the Embarrass River of 0.2 g/year (from 22.3 to 22.5 g/year), which would be offset by a 1.2 g/year net decrease in mercury loadings to the Partridge River (from 24.2 to 23.0 g/year), resulting in a combined overall decrease in mercury loading to the St. Louis River of 1.0 g/year. We disagree with the treatment of mercury in the FEIS and the resulting conclusions in three fundamental ways. In contrast to what is laid out in the FEIS, it is our expert opinion that: I. Increased mercury loadings to the Embarrass River may not be permittable. A net decrease in mercury loadings to the St. Louis River does not justify or make acceptable the increased mercury loadings to Embarrass River. II. The mass balance analyses that lead to the conclusion that mercury loadings will not increase in the St. Louis River are flawed in numerous ways. Mercury loadings to the St. Louis River are in fact likely to increase as a result of the NorthMet Project. III. While mercury loadings to the Partridge, Embarrass, and St. Louis Rivers are discussed, there is no adequate consideration of the fact that more of the mercury entering these systems will be in the form of methyl, rather than inorganic, mercury. This has the potential to greatly impact fish tissue mercury in these systems and the subsequent risk to fish consumers, both human and wildlife. Each of these three points is explained, in brief, below. I. Increased Mercury Loadings to the Embarrass River are not Legally Permittable. The Embarrass River flows through a chain of lakes including Wynn, Sabin, Embarrass, and Esquagama Lakes. Each of these lakes are on the 303(d) Impaired Waters List for mercury in fish tissue. In addition, Wynn and Sabin Lakes are on the proposed 2014 303(d) Impaired Waters list for mercury in the water column. According to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Friends of Pinto Creek vs. the U.S. EPA (“The Carlota Decision”), a new discharge that would further degrade waters with existing water quality impairments cannot be permitted. The decision further clarified that the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) does not have a provision that allows for “trades” in which increased pollutant discharges to one waterbody can be offset by decreases to another. Therefore it appears that under the CWA, a new source such as the NorthMet Project cannot discharge additional mercury to these mercury impaired waters. According to the FEIS, the NorthMet project would increase mercury loadings to the Embarrass River (which includes the lakes through which it passes) by 0.2 g/year (from 22.3 to 22.5 g/year). This does not appear, based on the Carlota Decision, to be permittable. Similarly, based on the Carlota Decision, it does not appear that the additional loading can be offset by decreases in mercury loadings to the Partridge River, as argued in the FEIS.",,,,,Table 8-1 of the FEIS
Esteban Chiriboga,"According to federal regulations [40 CFR 1502.16 (c)], a proposed action’s EIS must include a discussion of “possible conflicts between the proposed action and the objectives of federal, regional, state, and local land use plans, policies and controls for the area concerned.” It is further stated in 40 CFR 1506.2 (d) that “to better integrate environmental impact statements into state or local planning processes, statements shall discuss any inconsistency of a proposed action with any approved state or local plan and laws (whether or not federally sanctioned). Where an inconsistency exists, the statement should describe the extent to which the agency would reconcile its proposed action with the plan or law.” One such program with which the NorthMet Project is inconsistent is the Lake Superior Binational Program’s Zero Discharge Demonstration Program (ZDDP), as described in the Lake Superior Lakewide Management Plan (LaMP). The ZDDP established Lake Superior as a demonstration project to achieve zero discharge and zero emission of nine toxic, persistent, and bioaccumulative chemicals, including mercury, from within the Lake Superior basin by 2020. The LaMP Critical Contaminants Goal further states that “levels of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals should not impair beneficial uses of the natural resources of the Lake Superior basin.” The FEIS only mentions the ZDDP and the LaMP once, and only in Appendix A (A-405, Theme MERC 01; A-464 Theme PERM 27) in response to previous concerns raised about the failure to discuss the Project’s inconsistencies with these programs. The MERC 01 Thematic Response describes the ZDDP, but in no way discusses how the Project would address the fact that increased mercury loadings to the Embarrass River are in direct violation of the objectives of the ZDDP. Theme PERM 27 raises the concern that the Project is inconsistent with the LaMP, but the Thematic Response states only that, if permitted, the Project would be required to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

Esteban Chiriboga,"All surface waters within the Lake Superior basin, including all NorthMet Project area waters, are designated Outstanding International Resource Waters (OIRW) under Minnesota (MN) Administrative Rule 7050.0470. MN Rules 7052.0300 and 7052.0350 prohibit any new or expanded point source discharges of bioaccumulative substances of immediate concern (BSIC), including mercury, to any OIRW. Thus, under MN law, as under the federal law as described above, increased mercury loadings to the Embarrass River, or any other likely affected surface waters, do not appear to be permittable. All waters likely to be impacted by the NorthMet Project lie within the 1854 ceded territories. Several Chippewa tribes retain the right to hunt, fish, and gather throughout this territory, according to the 1854 Treaty of LaPointe. The federal government has a trust responsibility to the Bands to maintain these treaty resources. The fact that the NorthMet Project would increase mercury loadings to the Embarrass River and the chain of lakes through which it flows (Wynn Lake, Sabin Lake, Embarrass Lake), which are already listed on the 303(d) Impaired Waters list for mercury in fish tissue, represents an adverse impact to a critical trust resource and should not be permitted.

Esteban Chiriboga,"II. Mercury Loadings to the St. Louis River are Likely to Increase as a Result of the NorthMet Project. The FEIS predicts that there will be a small decrease in mercury loadings to the Partridge River and thus an overall net decrease in mercury loadings to the St. Louis River, despite increased mercury loadings to the Embarrass River. In addition to the fact that a “tradeoff” between increased mercury loadings in the Embarrass River and decreased loadings in the Partridge River does not appear to be permittable (as described in Part I, above), critical flaws in the analysis of mercury in the FEIS have led to incorrect conclusions about mercury loadings from the NorthMet Project. It is likely the Project will actually result in a net increase in mercury loadings to the St. Louis River. Numerous critiques of the mercury mass balance analyses were submitted by GLIFWC staff and others as comments on the Project’s SDEIS and PFEIS. None of these concerns were addressed in the FEIS. Therefore, rather than detail each issue here, the main points are summarized. 1. The mass balance is based on flow estimates from flawed hydrologic models. A mass balance, by definition, relies on accurate estimations of concentration and flow. As a result, the accuracy of the predicted mercury loadings from the mass balance analyses is unreliable. See the hydrologic section for detail of the hydrology modeling issues that have been identified. 2. The mass balance at the plant site is dependent upon the assumption that the NorthMet tailings will adsorb mercury in a similar capacity as the existing LTVSMC tailings. This assumption is based on a 2006 bench top study conducted by Northeast Technical Services, Inc. (NTS). Study details can be found in Appendix B of FEIS reference “Barr 2007d.” This study is insufficient to predict the magnitude of mercury adsorption by the NorthMet tailings. The flask test was conducted over only an 8 hour period to model a centuries long process. There was only one sample with no replication and no attempt to mimic in situ conditions. Further, the study results were incorrectly interpreted, stating that after rapid initial adsorption, mercury levels remained stable throughout the experiment. In reality, the mercury concentrations in the water nearly doubled between hours 4 and 8, when the experiment was terminated, increasing from <0.5 to 0.9 ng/L. If this trend continued, the water would exceed the 1.3 ng/L GLI standard for mercury by hour 12.",MERC,S,N,8,"SDEIS Themes MERC 01, MERC 06, MERC 11. It is also scientifically incorrect to compare well water in a tailing pond to water in a pore fluid environment outside the basin and conclude that mercury has been leached from the tailings along the flow path. This is because water in the tailings ponds is going to be affected by its own local environmental processes noted in the comment. In general, standing water tends to lose mercury over time as the mercury is lost to sediment or degasses Hg0 to the atmosphere."
Esteban Chiriboga,"A superior test of the ability of NorthMet tailings to adsorb mercury was also performed by NTS, but was not discussed in the FEIS. Details can be found in the FEIS reference “SRK 2007b” (see discussion of mercury on page 82 of the reference). In contrast to the 8 hour bench top study, the results indicated that precipitation coming into contact with Duluth Complex rock decreased from 12 to 1.9-3.6 ng/L over 32 days, suggesting while the tailing may have some capacity to adsorb mercury, the tailings basin water is still unlikely to meet the 1.3ng/L GLI standard.",WAT,S,O,8,FEIS pg. 5-229 to 5-230

In addition, the adsorption sites can be unstable as a result of environmental conditions such as changes in pH, resulting in the release of previously adsorbed mercury. In fact, there is already existing seepage from the LTVSMC tailings exceeding the 1.3ng/L GLI standard, as shown in Table 4.2.2-35 of the FEIS.",,,,,
Esteban Chiriboga,"The mine site mass balance does not account for seepage from the saturated overburden at the OSLA. This material contains sequestered mercury from past deposition. This is a particular concern for the peat overburden, as peat is known to be particularly efficient at sequestering mercury.

Esteban Chiriboga,"The mine site mass balance and estimates of mercury concentrations in the West Pit are supported by data presented in the FEIS for analog lakes. The data (FEIS Table 5.2.2-48) shows average mercury concentrations of 0.66 and 0.97 ng/L for analog natural seepage lakes and pit lakes, respectively. The more detailed source data for this summary table can be seen in Section 6.6 of the FEIS reference “PolyMet 2015m.” At least 6 of the 26 analog lakes had individual samples over the GLI standard of 1.3ng/L, and two lakes had average concentrations above 1.3ng/L. Further, data collected by the Fond du Lac Band [available upon request] on total mercury in concentrations in seepage lakes on or near the Fond du Lac reservation between 2011 and 2014 suggest that levels may be much higher in analog natural seepage lakes closer to the proposed Project, than those presented in the FEIS which were further away in Voyagers National Park and sampled over a decade ago. For the 27 lakes sampled by the Fond du Lac Band, 22 had individual samples over the 1.3ng/L GLI standard, and 20 had mean concentrations exceeding 1.3ng/L. Of the 59 samples collected and analyzed from these lakes, 36 (61%) exceeded 1.3ng/L. This suggests that the analog lakes chosen for analysis in the FEIS are not representative of area lakes and underestimate the predicted West Pit mercury concentration. It is likely that the mercury concentration in the West Pit will exceed the GLI standard.",WAT,S,N,8,"Any WWTP discharge and the WWTF discharge to the environment during closure are subject to the 1.3 ng/L water quality standard for total mercury. If estimated average concentrations of total mercury that would occur at the West Pit at the time of overflow during closure were underestimated, FEIS Section 5.2.2.3.5 identifies potential adaptive management strategies that would be implemented as necessary. Adaptive management strategies would include pretreatment modifications such as a chemical scavenger addition ahead of the greensand filter units to obtain additional metals, the use of tighter RO membranes for the primary RO system, treatment of some portion of the Vibratory Shear Enhanced Process (VSEP) permeate by the primary RO system to further remove some dissolved constituents, and addition of polishing treatment units for removal of trace metals (e.g., ion exchange)."
Esteban Chiriboga,"The mass balance analyses do not include mercury from air deposition, which has been quantified but is only treated independently.

Esteban Chiriboga,"There is little confidence in the predicted tailings basin seepage capture rates, causing this mercury source to be underestimated. Predicted compliance with water quality standards is entirely dependent on the assumption that >90% of the seepage will be captured. The seepage capture efficiencies assumed in the FEIS are overly optimistic considering that the seepage capture systems at the MINNTAC tailings basin and the southern toe of the LTV basin have not been able to achieve these high efficiency rates. Any water that is not captured by the proposed capture systems that enters the waters of the U.S. is subject to NPDES permitting.",PD,NS,X,1,
Esteban Chiriboga,"The FEIS further states that the mass balance estimates are conservative because waters will be further treated by reverse osmosis (RO) to remove additional mercury. According to FEIS reference “Barr 2013f”, mercury capture rates by RO are known to be as low as 22%. Further, the capture rate is highly dependent on the form of mercury, with only particulate mercury generally being captured. Capture efficiency for free mercury is much lower. The only available data for methylmercury shows that RO is not capable of removing methylmercury.

If the first model is accepted then wetlands and the upper Partridge River may be little affected by pit dewatering but dewatering of the Peter-Mitchell pits causes a bedrock northward flowpath to develop at closure.

DNR asserts that it is possible to detect and prevent any northward flowpath before any impacts are realized. Final EIS Section 5.2.2.3.6 details specific monitoring requirements, including expansion of the existing system of bedrock groundwater monitoring wells.

It is our expert opinion that the Project will result in a higher percentage of mercury in the form of methylmercury in receiving and downstream waters which will result in increased mercury entering the aquatic food web and ultimately higher fish tissue mercury.

Esteban Chiriboga,"Ombrotrophic bogs, which are peat-dominated, primarily rain-fed, and acidic, are extremely efficient mercury methylating environments. This methylation can be further enhanced by the addition of sulfate containing runoff. The FEIS does not present a consistent model for mine site hydrology. For many years the lead agencies have maintained that these peatland bogs are “perched” and therefore independent from any mercury and sulfate impacts on receiving waters (See GLIFWC comments on indirect wetland impacts above). In contrast to this position, the FEIS states that water can move from the surficial aquifer (where the wetlands are) to bedrock in a dewatering situation (FEIS page 5-111). These conflicting conceptual models of mine site groundwater hydrology are mutually exclusive. For mercury and methylmercury related conclusions to be defensible, a consistent model of the mine site hydrology must be developed. Any wetlands that have at least a partial connection to the groundwater should be considered a potential source of methylmercury. Enhanced vertical hydraulic gradients resulting from mine pit dewatering could result in significant interactions between the bogs and groundwater, even dewatering wetlands that may be entirely surface water dependent under normal conditions. If groundwater under these wetlands were to be drawn down, the wetlands would be impacted and there would be a likely dewatering of peat deposits.

These dust sized particles of ore are highly reactive and would escape through hinges and openings on the rail cars.

Rather the lead agencies took the technical response memo presented by the applicant and adopted it as their own. Underground Mine Alternative. The Underground Mining Alternative Assessment for the NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange Environmental Impact Statement document dated February 5th 2013 provides the lead agency rationale for eliminating the alternative from further analysis in the FEIS. The document states that for an alternative to be evaluated it must meet 5 screening criteria: 1. be technically feasible 2. be available 3. offer significant environmental benefits over the proposed project 4. meet the purpose and need 5. be economically feasible The co-lead agency position paper correctly states that the underground alternative would offer significant environmental benefits over the proposed action. In some areas these benefits would be substantial. The roughly 1000 acre wetland fill could be almost completely eliminated and the amount of tailings and waste rock generated by the project would be significantly reduced. The water quality and quantity impacts on surface and groundwater would be mitigated. This is particularly important given the probability that the NorthMet project is likely to violate water quality standards and the certainty that the project would require perpetual water treatment. In addition to the environmental benefits the document correctly states that underground mining is technically feasible and available at the site. It is important to note that with underground mining the land exchange with the Superior National Forest would not be needed therefore environmentally sensitive areas like the 100 mile swamp and essential lynx habitat would remain in the federal estate. The only rationale that is used to eliminate the alternative is economic feasibility. However, no detailed economic information is provided to support that claim. All other objectives of the purpose and need statements in section 1.3.2.1 of the FEIS are met. Therefore, the question on further analysis is determined by the applicants’ assessment of the economics of the alternative. In addition, no information on the economic benefits of an underground mining alternative are mentioned. These benefits include: • An underground mine would not require a land exchange with the United States Forest Service. • Economic benefits (environmental goods and services) provided by wetlands that would not be excavated (see ecosystem valuation section). • Economic impact of perpetual maintenance and water treatment at the site. Of note, there is no discussion on the cost of wetland mitigation activities that are needed with an open pit mine. An underground mine would not require extensive wetlands mitigation costs for wooded swamp and bog sites that could reach between $35,460,000-$110,205,000 (i.e. 1200 acres x 1.5 rate x $19,700/acre ACOE source and 1200 acres x 1.5 rate x $61,225/acre MN Department of Transportation – (Environmental Law Institute, 2007 and US ACOE, 2010). The Underground Mining Alternative Assessment relied heavily on an InfoMine model to determine economic feasibility. However there is no detail on the model itself, the model assumptions or how the model calculates its results. For a complete evaluation of the alternative, a review of this model should have been done by the co-lead agencies. Finally, it appears likely that the project as proposed is likely to violate applicable water quality standards. This means that the current proposal is not likely to be permitted. Furthermore, underground mining would not result in excavation of overburden and would not result in mercury and methylmercury emissions at the mine site. Because of this, it seems reasonable that an underground alternative be considered as an additional mitigation measure.",ALT,S,O,3,"FEIS Ref MDNR 2013a.

Esteban Chiriboga,"West Pit Backfill Alternative. Based on the lead agency memorandum titled Co-lead Agencies’ Consideration of a West Pit Backfill Alternative dated April 11, 2013 it is clear that this alternative meets the purpose and need, is available, is technically feasible, and is economically feasible. The document argues that environmental benefits are unclear. However, because of the screening level analysis used by the co-lead agencies the full effect of the alternative on the environment is not known. Page 3 indicates that there is no information to determine water quality projections under this alternative. Therefore the primary potential benefit of this alternative is not addressed. Until this information is developed, GLIFWC staff maintain that backfill of the west pit may provide long term water quality benefits. Given that the current project is likely to violate water quality standards, additional mitigation is needed and this alternative should be more fully analyzed. The proposed NorthMet project proposes to mine a relatively small portion of the ore body. Figure 3.2-10 of the FEIS indicates that an upper mineralization zone and a portion of the Unit 1 mineralization are the targets. This mine plan appears to leave behind a substantial portion of ore. GLIFWC staff has argued that the remaining ore could be accessed through underground mining methods. According to the co-lead Agencies’ document “Consideration of a West Pit Backfill Alternative” dated April 11, 2013, a major reason for the development of an open pit mine plan is that there is a lease agreement between PolyMet and the owners of mineral rights immediately southwest of the toe of NorthMet’s west pit. These private lease agreements apparently include using the west pit as a portal for future mining activities. In addition, tribal cooperating agencies have provided the lead agencies with PowerPoint presentations from PolyMet staff to their investors that tout the potential for future mining of these mineral resources southwest of the west pit. If the west pit is to be used as a portal for this future mining, then that should be described in the FEIS and the environmental consequences assessed. The Evaluation of Backfilling the NorthMet West Pit (December 2012) states on page 2 “mineralization on the western end is much more flat laying, dipping at about 15 degrees and could be developed in the future via expansion of the proposed open pit mining operation and/or underground mining from the base of the west pit.” It appears that the FEIS is describing a project that is not complete in that future mining is not included. What are the implications of developing an underground mine that extends from the west pit to surface and groundwater resources of the Partridge River watershed? Another stated reason for avoiding backfill for the west pit is the lease requirement of not encumbering the mineral resources to the southwest. The assertion that backfilling the west pit would encumber minerals is ludicrous. We disagree with the notion that the only way to access minerals at depth is through the bottom of the west pit. These minerals could be accessed through other standard underground mining techniques from other locations. In fact, these minerals are accessible now and would continue to be accessible even if the NorthMet project is never built. Taking advantage of an existing pit may provide economic benefits to a mining company but it is unclear why a regulatory agency would prefer this method without first conducting an analysis. If the co-lead agencies are taking the position that the preferred alternative of a future underground project includes a portal through the west pit, then they need to provide a scientifically defensible reason for that decision. Finally, the co-lead Agencies’ Consideration of a West Pit Backfill Alternative dated April 11, 2013 provides several reasons for the conclusion that backfill would not provide significant environmental and socioeconomic improvements over the proposed action. Page 3 of the document clearly states that there has been no analysis done to support these conclusions. It appears that economic considerations of a future mine expansion are the only concrete reasons for not conducting an analysis of the environmental and socioeconomic benefits of backfilling the west pit. The NorthMet project as proposed is a perpetual maintenance and water treatment facility. It seems logical that every available option that might improve the long term impacts of the project should be explored regardless of the commitments that applicant may have made on their mineral lease. GLIFWC staff suggests that this alternative has been eliminated prematurely and that a full analysis is needed.",ALT,S,O,3,"MDNR, et al. 2013b.

Esteban Chiriboga,"The discussion of socioeconomic effects of the proposed NorthMet project is inadequate. The IMPLAN model is the primary tool for assessing the economic benefits of the proposed project. However, IMPLAN cannot calculate the negative effects of a mine project on other areas of the economy that depend on unspoiled and healthy natural environments (tourism, hunting, etc.). In addition, IMPLAN cannot assess the economic impact of the proposed project on ecosystem goods and services that nature provides to society. An example of these ecosystem goods and services is free water treatment and flood controls provided by wetlands. If the NorthMet project is permitted, thousands of acres of wetlands will be destroyed and their water treatment functions will have to be replaced by a constructed treatment plant costing millions of dollars a year to operate. Recently, an ecosystem services valuation has been completed for the St. Louis River watershed (Attachment B). This document provides many of the data and tools needed to properly assess the effects of the proposed project on the goods and services that the area provides. Tribal cooperating agencies and intertribal agencies asked the co- lead agencies to include the ecosystem valuation information in the FEIS. This request was declined. GLIFWC staff used the information in the Ecosystem Valuation Report for the St. Louis River watershed to characterize the losses in ecosystem services to the watershed as a result of the land exchange and the NorthMet Mine. The analysis of direct impacts includes wetlands filled at both the mine and plant sites. The analysis of indirect wetland impact focuses on the mine site of the proposed project which is the area of the proposed land exchange and does not include indirect wetland impacts at the plant site (Attachment C). This is one of the possible applications of the ecosystem valuation information that should have been done by the co-lead agencies as part of the NorthMet FEIS.",SO,S,O,2,"SDEIS Themes SO 02, SO 04, SO 07, SO 08; FEIS Section 5.2.10.1.4 (Environmental Costs and Non- Market Values)."
Esteban,The FEIS does not provide an adequate level of information on financial assurance. The FEIS lists items for which costs must,FIN,S,O,8,"FEIS Sections 1.4.5, 2.5, 3.2.2.4"
Chiriboga,"be included in the financial assurance instrument (i.e. demolition of all structures and remediation of sites, fencing the perimeters, sloping and seeding the overburden, constructing outlet structures, removing culverts, etc.) yet fails to provide any estimated costs or the basis for these costs. This section also notes that reclamation and postreclamation costs are required yet fails to provide any estimated costs or the basis for their estimation (i.e. quantities, unit costs, inflation estimates). The FEIS provides an initial estimate for 3 years of operation (Table 3.2-15). However, there is no basis for their estimation or other assumptions. The FEIS failed to provide detailed costs for the physical closure and reclamation of the mine site that will need to be covered by financial assurance instruments, a detailed discussion as to how much money will be needed from financial assurance instruments and when. The basis for physical closure and reclamation costs need to be based on the private sector costs and include realistic profit margins when performing cleanup tasks. Cost to be covered by Financial Assurance need to include detailed information and cover the following areas: 1) interim operations and maintenance for agencies when a company declares bankruptcy and leaves the site, 2) water management and treatment, 3) removal of hazardous wastes and substances, 4) demolition, removal and disposal of facilities and equipment, 5) earthwork (sloping, backfill, grading), 6) re-vegetation, 7) long-term operations and maintenance, 8) Monitoring costs, 9) detailed inflation estimates, 9) provide a cash flow analysis, and 10) detail assumptions in the determination of risk and uncertainty. The FEIS should have included the lifecycle of the pollution control structures built, estimates for their original construction costs, and projections for replacement costs for timeframes of hundreds to thousands of years. In addition to providing detailed cost estimation, the FEIS should have identified and communicated assumptions regarding inflation rates, rates of return, contingencies, and labor rates. Closure and maintenance costs will need to be covered years into the future, so a net present value should have been part of the FEIS. For example, reverse osmosis is being proposed at the mine as a means of treating the mine’s waste water and ensure compliance with water quality standards. Water treatment at this site is indefinite but will certainly be required for centuries. EPA has assessed reverse osmosis pollution control technology at mine sites within its Reference Guide to Treatment Technologies for Mining-Influenced Water published in March 2014 (EPA, 2014) and noted the following: • Reverse osmosis is a proven method to demineralize acid mine drainage. However, it does require significant construction and operating costs. • With pre-treatment and routine maintenance, membranes typically last two to five years and frequent membrane monitoring and maintenance are required to ensure the effective operation of a reverse osmosis system. • Management and disposal of the brine solution that is generated can require higher operating costs. In arid climates, atmospheric evaporation may offer a technique for removing water in the brine solution followed by appropriate solid waste disposal. For locations where atmospheric evaporation is not feasible, thermal treatment may be needed. The FEIS states that the atmospheric evaporation technique would be used at NorthMet. However, the feasibility of this proposal has not been evaluated. • Reverse osmosis is also in use at the Kennecott South site, which is located in the Salt Lake Valley, east-southeast of Copperton, Utah. The Bingham Canyon Water Treatment Plant (BCWTP), built as part of the site’s remedy, is located in operable unit (OU) 2. Reverse osmosis is being used as the primary technology for addressing total dissolved solids- and sulfate impacted ground water.... The total cost for the BCWTP was about $16.1 million (2013 USD). Total yearly operation and maintenance costs (40 percent of these costs represent labor and 24-hour maintenance) for the BCWTP are about $1.3 million (2013 USD). These capital and yearly operation and maintenance costs include energy requirements, but do not reflect the costs associated with extraction wells, feed pipelines, disposal infrastructure and off-site disposal. It is obvious that reverse osmosis requires high capital costs for the purchase, installation and operation of the membrane system. For a 1-million-gpd system, the total installed cost is estimated at $42.9 million (2013 USD). Annual operation and maintenance costs for the same system are estimated at $3.2 million (2013 USD). However, other features of the proposed mine will need to function indefinitely and must also be financially assured. The FEIS provides a listing of contingencies that may have to be covered by financial instruments including: 1) physical difficulties in implementing reclamation plans, 2) escalating standards of closure, reclamation, and long-term monitoring, 3) unanticipated liabilities, 4) unplanned cessation of mining, 5) failure of the mining company, and 6) failure or limitations on the ability of third parties to pay reclamation costs. Unfortunately the FEIS provides no discussion as to any of the costs of the contingencies that are identified. The FEIS also fails to discuss how financial instruments would be structured to meet those contingencies or the assumptions made by PolyMet to ensure an adequate stream of revenue is available to meet closure and maintenance costs. What fundamental economic assumptions are being made when PolyMet proposes to use surety bonds, irrevocable letters of credit, cash and cash equivalents, trust funds, insurance policies, or a combination of these Financial Assurance Instruments? The FEIS failed to clearly state how the State of Minnesota will determine the maximum bond requirements, how it estimated direct reclamation costs, how it determined its estimates for inflation (i.e. periodic bond recalculation or calculate an Inflation factor using a common index, such as the Construction Cost Indexes (CCI) from the Engineering News Record), and how it will determine indirect reclamation costs and how it will calculate the total bond amount. Historically, mining companies are temporary entities that disband soon after a mine project comes to an end. In reality, it is likely that PolyMet will not exist during post closure. The most reasonable scenario for long term closure is that a state or federal agency will be responsible for monitoring, maintenance, and cleanup activities because a mining company cannot be held accountable if it no longer exists. Similarly, the assumption that financial assurance instruments can be developed to ensure that funds will be available centuries from now is not logical. The State of Minnesota has existed for 155 years. The United States of America has existed for 237 years. The notion that a mining company and financial assurance instruments will be available to work on a mine site 500 years from now or longer, is not believable.",,,,,
Esteban Chiriboga,The mine site MODFLOW model was incorrectly bounded and calibrated and does not provide the hydrologic characterization of the site that is needed in order to perform adequate project impact evaluation,WAT,S,O,8,MDNR et al. 2015c.
Esteban Chiriboga,"Unfortunately, the existing project MODFLOW model for the PolyMet mine site was calibrated using P-M taconite pit water levels that were 13 or more meters too high. The project model incorporates the P-M pits as constant-head-cell boundary conditions (FEIS Figure 5.2.2-2 or attached as Figure 1). The project model sets the P-M pit lakes as constant-head-cells approximately 5 meters above the level of the upper Partridge River, yet pit lakes during the period when flow data was collected (1979-88) were actually well below the elevation of the upper Partridge. Because of this error, the calibration model has the local direction of groundwater flow from the pits 180 degrees reversed from the actual conditions during the calibration period. The model predicts that during the calibration period water was flowing from the hydrologic high at the P-M pits to the hydrologic low at the upper Partridge River, when in fact, because the pits were partly to completely empty, water would have been flowing from the upper Partridge River to the P-M pits.",WAT,S,N,12,"Co-lead Agencies' Response for GLIFWC Comments on Calibration of the Mine Site MODFLOW Model to Partridge River Groundwater Baseflows; MDNR, et. al., October 12, 2015."
Esteban Chiriboga,"The significance of this is that using the high 1996 Peter-Mitchel pit water levels during calibration is likely to have resulted in restrictive (i.e. low) formation conductivities and recharge in order to force the model to match calibration targets. In order to conservatively estimate maximum PolyMet project pit inflows, the models should have been calibrated with realistic P-M water levels and only during pit inflow predictive runs should the P-M pit water levels been raised to their likely maximum level such as that found in 1996. Such procedures for worst-case scenario analysis (Anderson et al. 2015, Section 10.4.1 Scenario Modeling) is basic to hydrologic modeling.",WAT,S,N,12,Sensitivity runs of the Mine Site MODFLOW model predictions for pit inflows were conducted for the Final EIS; see pages 5-35 through 5-37.

That quality control document has errors and misstatements, raising questions about adequate quality control. For example the local scale models were 8 layers, not the 7 stated in the MTRC, and the software used for the base case was outdated MODFLOW96 not the current industry standard MODFLOW-NWT. These errors cast doubt on the adequacy of the review to which the groundwater models were subjected.",WAT,S,O,8,"ERM Water Team, November 11, 2015 NorthMet EIS Phase 4 Water Models Quality Assurance Technical Memorandum"
Esteban Chiriboga,"The closure period model, on which the sensitivity analysis was conducted, was configured with boundary condition in the form of P-M pit water levels at their 1996 levels, over 300 feet higher than the water levels actually expected at closure. Those P-M pits are close to the center of the model used for sensitivity analysis and, therefore, erroneous boundary conditions of this magnitude invalidate the results of the sensitivity analysis. Not only was the calibration model incorrectly bounded but the closure predictive runs use the same abnormally high P-M pit water levels. In particular the predictive runs for long-term closure (MODFLOW run ""SS_west_fill_Sept2014_1585ec1595"" resulting in Large Figures 29 and 30 of PolyMet 2015m) use the 1996 taconite pit water levels that are over 300 feet higher than the expected closure water levels. nan",WAT,S,N,12,"The EIS was not scoped to address how future activity at the Peter Mitchell Pit might influence the closure conditions at the NorthMet site.

Esteban Chiriboga,"Project documents include very clear statements about the importance of MODFLOW in formulating impacts, for example PolyMet 2015m Section 5.1.2.6 states: ""Groundwater contours for the unconsolidated deposits and bedrock are the primary source of information used to delineate the flow path areas. The groundwater contours are from the Mine Site MODFLOW model"" The GoldSim contaminant transport modeling in particular uses many outputs from the MODFLOW groundwater modeling (attached as Tables 2 and 3). These extend far beyond the stated purpose of the groundwater model; which in one of several statements was to ""estimate the amount of pit inflow and evaluate groundwater flow conditions following pit closure (SDEIS reference Polymet 2013i; available at: http://www.lic.wisc.edu/glifwc/polymet/sdeis/references/ ), thus making it very clear that a valid model that characterizes site groundwater hydrology is foundational for impact prediction. The project MODFLOW model was used to characterize post closure contaminant flow paths (Large Figures 28 & 29 of PolyMet 2015m , attached as Figures 3 & 4, and FEIS Figure 5.2.2-7) and the general nature of the groundwater system such as mine site groundwater levels at closure (e.g. Large Figure 30 of Attachment B of PolyMet 2015m, attached as Figure 6). In addition, the MODFLOW model was used to supply the numeric input parameters to the GoldSim model that is used for prediction of contaminant flow and contaminant concentrations (PolyMet 2015m , Table 1-1). That table, attached as Table 3, identifies critical GoldSim input parameters that are outputs from the mine site MODFLOW groundwater model.",WAT,S,O,8,MDNR et al. 2015c

That is simply not true. In a 2012 technical memo of the Water Modeling Data package of the SDEIS (SDEIS reference PolyMet 2013i), Barr Engineering stated: ""The primary objectives of the models were to: ? Estimate the amount of groundwater inflow that can be expected to flow into the mine pits during operations and pit filling, and ? Evaluate groundwater flow conditions following pit closure."" In Attachment B of the FEIS reference PolyMet 2015m, Barr stated that: ""The primary objective of this study was to estimate the amount of groundwater expected to flow into the mine pits during operations and pit flooding, and to evaluate the groundwater flow conditions following pit closure."" and presented model results on mine pit outflow: ""Simulated groundwater flow rates for the long-term closure simulations are shown in Table 4- 4."" and ""Table 4-4 Estimated Groundwater Inflow and Outflow Rates – Long-term Closure Conditions"" In their October 12 memo (attached) the co-leads make yet another characterization of modeling purpose: ""The stated purpose of the MODFLOW model is to predict pit inflows and characterize hydrogeologic conditions between the NorthMet mine pits and the Partridge River."" While we don't disagree that these as some of the purposes to which MODFLOW was put, we believe that the many written statements by PolyMet and the co-leads and the many uses that the MODFLOW results were put to in writing the FEIS (documented in the previous paragraphs) most completely illustrate the true uses of the MODFLOW modeling in this project.",WAT,S,N,12,"FEIS Section 5.2.2.2.1 identifies MODFLOW provided ""estimates of hydraulic head distributions, groundwater flow/directions in the surficial aquifer and bedrock units, and groundwater releases to perennial streams (groundwater baseflow)...MODFLOW modeling results and site characterization data were used to delineate groundwater flowpaths at the Mine Site."" Contrary to the comment, DNR asserts that the Final EIS listing is a reasonable outcome of satisfying Final SDD requirements for the groundwater flow model to predict pit inflows at various stages of pit development (i.e., year 1, year 5, year 10, year 20) and include operation, closure, and post-closure."
Esteban Chiriboga,"Because of the dependence of the GoldSim modeling of contaminant transport on MODFLOW model outputs, it is essential that the MODFLOW outputs be valid.

Esteban Chiriboga,"There is no consistent conceptual model of site hydrology. The conceptual model used for the basis of many of the conclusions in project reports and in the FEIS text is that the nearby taconite pits have little influence on the surrounding aquifer, regardless of whether they are full of water or pumped dry. This is a notion that was proposed early in the project and drove many of the data collection and EIS decisions. On the other hand, the mine site MODFLOW model, which incorporates historical and site-specific conductivity data on the bedrock formations and is used by the applicant to predict closure conditions, indicates that the nearby taconite pits have a profound impact on the surrounding aquifer.",WAT,S,N,12,"There is no definitive means to address the issue raised in the comment because the EIS was not scoped to address how future activity at the Peter Mitchell Pit might influence the closure conditions at the NorthMet site. The modeling satisfies Final SDD Section 6.2, which required the groundwater flow model to predict inflows at various stages of pit development (i.e., year 1, year 5, year 10, year 20) and include operation, closure, and post-closure. DNR notes the Mine Site MODFLOW model reflects available information between the proposed NorthMet project site and the Northshore Peter Mitchell Mine pits. Even with improved data and analytical techniques, proximity alone to a taconite facility does automatically result in commensurate effects to local hydrology. There is no evidence that the Partridge River, 100 Mile Swamp, or Argo and Iron Lakes, have been measurably impacted by Northshore Mining activity to date; whether this would hold into the future is uncertain.

Although not assessed quantitatively, DNR has considered potential future operations at the Northshore Mine against information that is available. DNR acknowledges it cannot rule out that future operations at the Northshore Mine could induce northward groundwater bedrock flow from the NorthMet Mine Site. See Final EIS Section 6.2.2.3.1. This might happen if there is insufficient natural downward leakage into bedrock from the overlying wetlands and surficial materials between the proposed NorthMet Mine (in closure) and the Northshore Mine (in future operations and closure). If there is sufficient downward leakage, then there would be groundwater flow divide between the two mines where there is no continuous one-way flow between the facilities. If natural leakage is insufficient to maintain a groundwater flow divide between the two facilities, then it is possible a northward groundwater flowpath would be present. DNR asserts that it is possible to detect and prevent any northward flowpath before any impacts are realized. Regarding detection of any northward flow, it is reasonable for the Final EIS to detail in Section 5.2.2.3.6 specific monitoring requirements, including expansion of the existing system of bedrock groundwater monitoring wells. The goal of the monitoring would be to determine future bedrock flow direction immediately north of the NorthMet pits to identify any need for engineered preventive mitigation measures. Regarding prevention of any northward flow, it is reasonable for the Final EIS to detail in Section 5.2.2.3.5 the types of known measures that could be applied if a potential for northward flow is detected.

RICHARD AND CAROL STAFFON,"Approval of the PolyMet project will aggravate water quality problems, certainly in the St. Louis River watershed, and potentially in the Rainy River watershed. Sitting at the top of both of these watersheds, PolyMet will add higher levels of sulfates to the downstream waters. Sulfates in the Partridge and Embarrass rivers, and in the St. Louis River downstream from them already greatly exceed normal background levels because of drainage from taconite mines to the north. Much additional sulfate will be added to these watersheds as a result of the PolyMet project. Higher levels of sulfates in downstream waters will allow microbes to convert more of the available mercury to methylmercury, which is the bioaccumulating formulation that contaminates our fish, and humans eating those fish, boosting already unsafe levels of methylmercury contamination in these waters. The PolyMet project will also add more mercury to these river systems. Release of mercury sequestered in peat soils, increases in water level fluctuations, and airborne mercury released from the PolyMet mine and plant sites will all contribute to the already high levels of mercury in the system. The St. Louis River was listed for mercury impairment by the PCA in 1998. Since then little progress has been made to come up with a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plan to get the river delisted. By adding more mercury and sulfate to the river system, the PolyMet project will make it even more difficult to accomplish this challenging goal to make the fish safer for people to eat. The FEIS does not answer the question of how the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (PCA) can meet the goal of cleaning up the water in the St. Louis River, while at the same time adding more mercury and sulfate pollution to it.",MERC,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme MERC 02

Since this and even lesser storms are not adequately modeled in the designs, one can only imagine the consequences of a 500 or 1000-year flood on the Iron Range. The collection and treatment facility would likely be overwhelmed, or dikes fail, releasing untreated toxic contaminants, including heavy metals, into the headwaters.

The models knowingly referenced that ongoing water treatment would be necessary for hundreds of years after mining is completed.

RICHARD AND CAROL STAFFON,"PolyMet’s FEIS modeled the issue of where the runoff from the mining operation would flow. This is a foundation upon which this plan is built. We find it troubling that outside scientists from the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC) have questioned the “modeling assumptions” provided by DNR and used by PolyMet’s engineering firm, Barr Engineering, a firm that could gain substantial economic benefits by the mine’s approval and construction. The GLIFWC results showed that most of the runoff would run into the St. Louis, but some could also flow into the Rainy River watershed, where it could impact the nearby Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and possibly even downstream to Voyageurs National Park. It is our understanding that DNR rejected the request for an independent third party to review the findings, but has rerun the model and now concurs with the GLIFWIC findings. The FEIS proposes to deal with this issue through adaptive management. But again, as described above, we are concerned about the ability of regulatory agencies to successfully enforce permit requirements or of the mining industry to implement them, especially when significant costs are involved to fix the problem.

These seem unrealistic. Because of this assumption, the plan does not recommend the use of a geo membrane to reduce infiltration, nor is there a double liner with monitoring and leachate collection between liners, a standard practice for modern landfills, which is what this essentially is. There is also an assumption that there is no water flow through the fragmented bedrock. Anyone familiar with the Canadian Shield certainly understands that the rock has fractures. And if it doesn’t have multiple fractures before mining begins, the initiation of mine blasting is likely to induce some fractures within the area. Actual empirical data on rock permeability are needed for scientific conclusions.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 018

The emergency overflow would be provided for protection of the dams in the rare event that freeboard within the Tailings Basin is not sufficient to contain all storm water.” The fact that the overflow will be provided is important, but this should not be the sole protection in place to prevent a Mount Polley-type dam breach.

However, the FEIS states, “No reasonable alternatives were identified that would potentially offer substantial environmental benefits compared to the NorthMet Project Proposed Action.” We believe the FEIS has missed an opportunity to not only improve environmental protections, but also reduce long-term risks to the lives of people living near the tailings basins.

With low prices, like those we are currently experiencing, there will be a strong economic incentive to shave corners wherever possible. This could negatively affect environmental protections, mine safety and staffing levels, and lead to the familiar boom-bust cycle many mining operations and communities across the globe experience. When the State scrambles to help miners harmed by the iron/steel bust cycle, there is added incentive at the legislative and administrative levels to help the miners and company at the expense of the taxpayers and the environment. Marginal strategies are often employed to make the mining operation profitable again.",O,NS,X,1,

And there will be almost no mitigation in the headwaters of the Embarrass and Partridge Rivers, where all the wetland impacts occur. Additionally, there is no mention in the FEIS of if, or where, the indirect impacts and mitigation efforts would occur on potentially several thousand acres (6,568.8 to 7,694.2 acres depending on the assessment method used). Even if only 10% of these wetlands are indirectly impacted, as much as 770 acres of mitigation will still need to be found.

Instead, the FEIS says, “Environmental assessment of the NorthMet Project Proposed Action identified the potential for air quality effects at the Mine Site boundary.” (i.e. Air quality regulations are enforced only at the property boundary.) “A larger land exchange area would mitigate potential air quality issues; consequently, this alternative was eliminated from further consideration because it would not provide an adequate buffer.” The fact that the FEIS rejects shrinking the land exchange to only the lands necessary for the project, and rejects saving 3 square miles of the “100 mile swamp” simply because, if PolyMet owns the land they don't have to address their own air pollution, and the pollution will be diluted by a bigger ownership, seems unacceptable to us. The State should not accept this as a suitable mitigation strategy for the impacts caused by the mine’s air quality issues, and should instead seek alternative mitigation strategies to control the air pollution, while at the same time preserving three square miles of wild, undeveloped land (See page 183, Section 3.3.3.3.4).",ALT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme ALT 23

Rev. Elton W. Brown,"Thanks for extending the Comment Period. However, the massive amount of technical material in the PolyMet mining proposal remains more than my brain and time can handle. I attach below my original comments, because as far as I can see, this third version of the EIS still does not adequately address my concerns. The truly difficult issues, it seems to me, are being ignored, glossed over, or postponed. My fear is that, once the mining permits are issued, it will be too late to press the corporation on matters such as adequate Financial Assurance or production taxes; by then they will use the promise of imminent jobs as leverage to get their way. All this is crucial, because -- as we have been told by mine officials and politicians -- PolyMet is the ""snowplow"" paving the way for the eventual approval of Twin Metals and other mine projects. Rep. Rick Nolan hopes to expedite PolyMet's permitting by assuring us with this promise: “Make no mistake - the monitoring and enforcement process will be vigorous” -- and yet I see no serious effort to increase the funding for regulatory agencies nor any assurance that the Clean Water Act will be enforced with mine shutdowns and meaningful financial penalties rather than by tolerating violations and issuing variances. In addition, there is a very important new matter that is not considered in this FEIS, namely, the recent international climate change agreement. The carbon footprint of copper/nickel mining, including its sources of energy, will be enormous, flying in the face of our nation's commitment to reduce greenhouse gasses. The sulfide-mine industry in NE MN should at the very least be put on hold until these critical issues can be resolved and until the mining technology has improved to minimize the very real risks of environmental degradation.",GEN,NS,X,1,

The EIS describes no foolproof technique for preventing this exposure nor does it name any technology that has ever been developed to stop this process once it has begun. Furthermore no example is given of any sulfide mine that has ever succeeded in preventing this from occurring.,WAT,NS,X,1,

Gail C. Roberts,"1. It is stated in the FEIS that the underground mining alternative was ruled out because PolyMet could not afford the cost of developing an underground mine. It appears that rather than incurring the cost of an underground mine, PolyMet and associates are being allowed to claim they can provide high remediation costs in perpetuity rather than investing money in developing a mining project that would have reduced environmental impact in the first place. Long-term monitoring and remediation require considerable financial assurance for the State of Minnesota and likely an amount beyond the resources and capabilities of PolyMet and associates to provide. The untapped mineral resources of Minnesota should remain intact until such time as more well-tested methods of mining and containment of acid-mine waste are available. During that time market forces may change so that underground mining of the known mineral deposits will become economically feasible and be safer for the environment in the long run.",PER,NS,X,1,

Other parts of the modeling are based on unrealistic and unverified assumptions related to the theoretical and untested nature of the project design.

I strongly caution that if this project is allowed to go forth as planned, Minnesota will join the ranks of the many states in the Western Intermountain and Appalachian regions of the U.S. that currently must deal with one or more acid rock drainage superfund sites.",GEN,NS,X,1,
Henry V. Mott,"PolyMet’s geochemical modeling suggests that after a period of some 200 or so years, the water in the pit might be of quality to allow for discharge without treatment. While I am not privy to the details of PolyMet’s modeling efforts, I do fully understand the combination of limnological and hydrogeochemical processes involved in converting sulfide in exposed rock to sulfate and acid. The state of quantitative understanding of the sulfate producing process in deep water bodies is in its infancy. These predictions are nothing more than educated wild guesses. Basing a vital “here and now” decision, to allow the west pit to fill and behave entirely on its own volition, on the model prediction that west pit water quality would improve significantly over the next five centuries seems overly optimistic. The west pit, like all deep lakes in the northern U.S., would be dimictic. Each fall prior to freeze over the strong summer thermocline would disappear, and then in the spring, subsequent to ice-out, the weak winter thermocline would disappear. In the absence of the thermocline the combination of convective mixing due to thermal gradients and advective mixing due to wind action would lead to a brief condition wherein the pit would be completely mixed. Oxygen from the atmosphere would saturate water at the surface and that oxygen-saturated water would then be mixed throughout the water column, replenishing hypolimnetic saturation deficits brought about by microbial activity during isolation of the hypolimnion from the atmosphere by the thermocline. As a consequence, twice per year, each and every year, the depths of the west pit would be replenished with oxygen, providing the terminal electron acceptor for the electrons obtained by microbes from sulfide for their metabolic processes resulting in conversion of sulfide to sulfate and acid. As sulfides are leached from the geologic formations, the formations themselves would deteriorate at the solid-water interface, exposing additional fresh sulfide minerals to the microbial populations responsible for the acid-production process. This process would continue as long as the lake exists. The character of the ARD filling this pit can be exemplified by the ARD filling Montana’s Berkely pit. What’s in store for this sensitive Northern Minnesota ecosystem is hypolimnetic water with pH ~2.5, specific conductance of ~8600 microSiemens and redox potential of ~630 mV; epilimnetic water with pH ~2.5, specific conductance of 7900 microSiemens and redox potential of ~670 mV; and, overall, water with copper and zinc concentrations between 150 and 200 and between 500 and 600 mg/L, respectively (http://www.mbmg.mtech.edu/env/env-berkeley.asp, accessed 12/19/2015). The combination of redox potential and pH define a condition for which electron acceptors more thermodynamically preferred than sulfate would be present and for which sulfide, if present and accessible by the microbial population, would be a major electron donor. As long as the electron acceptors are present and as long as the sulfide is accessible, the acidification process would continue. The character of the ARD in Montana’s Berkely pit is entirely consistent with the set of cyclic limnologic processes described in the previous paragraph. This pit lake exists, it is a major problem in Montana, and the US EPA and the State of Montana have no really good plan as to how to deal with the pit waters when it fills and begins to overflow. This situation is what would be in store for Minnesota if PolyMet’s west pit is left open and allowed to fill and then overflow. The only measure standing between this acid generating situation and Minnesota’s sensitive water resources is PolyMet’s assurances that they would be around to fund and operate a treatment plant as long as is necessary. The mining industry has a strong track record for folding up holding companies and disappearing as soon as all the profits have been made. A simple filing of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy would transfer the responsibility to taxpayers of the State of Minnesota. Mining the sulfide-laden ore and leaving this pit open would be an environmental travesty committed right under the noses of the government whose responsibility is to be stewards for the environmental resources of the State of Minnesota.",FIN,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes FIN 04, FIN 06"
Henry V. Mott,"Category 1 waste rock is segregated from category 2-4 waste rock based on perceived reactivity, with category 1 being the lowest reactivity category. Key to this discussion is that category 1 waste rock could be and likely is reactive (Johnson, 2014). Certainly, the process of segregating the various categories of waste rock is not perfect. Segregation is based on a few tests and extrapolation of the results of those tests to define general locations within the geologic formations in which rock would be predicted to exhibit the various reactivities. Truly accurate categorization requires extensive testing, hardly feasible, of excavated samples at the time excavation and stockpiling occurs. Then, certainly, the category 1 waste rock pile could contain pockets of waste rock that are moderately to even highly reactive. Once acid production would begin in these “hot spots”, additional acid production would be kick started in waste rock that is of lower sulfide content. Translation: there could (and undoubtedly would) be significant quantities of exposed sulfide bearing rock in the category 1 waste rock stockpile that would catalyze acid production throughout the entire pile over the course of the storage period planned to last forever.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 134
Henry V. Mott,"Although PolyMet’s plans have been upgraded to improve the isolation of the waste rock pile from infiltrating water and to collect leachate produced by water entering the pile, the solution is still based on a “business as usual” approach of leaving the mining mess strewn over the surface of the Earth. The geomembrane cap is intended to isolate the waste rock from the environment in perpetuity. This geomembrane liner is similar in materials and configuration to a roofing membrane that is used to isolate the contents of a building from rain and snow.",WAT,S,N,8,PolyMet 2015d Section 3.2.2
Henry V. Mott,"While the environment beneath the soil cover would be more protective of the geomembrane than the mineral cover over a typical membrane roof system, root penetrations, the actions of burrowing animals and insects, freeze-thaw cycles, differential consolidation of the waste rock itself, microbial attacks on the organic materials of the membrane and numerous other processes un-thought of at this writing would over time compromise the geomembrane. PolyMet’s plan calls for twice yearly monitoring of vegetative cover protecting the cap to ensure woody growth does not occur – will PolyMet be around to do this in perpetuity? I think not. The isolation system will eventually fail and precipitation and oxygen will enter the waste rock pile. Sulfide will be converted to sulfate and toxic, acidic leachate will be produced. The net effect of isolation of this waste rock pile with a geomembrane will simply be to delay the inevitable production of acidity within the pile for decades, perhaps even a century or more. Then when the geomembrane does fail, long after PolyMet is no more, Minnesota’s water resources will be adversely impacted by the acid oozing from this waste rock pile.",WAT,S,O,8,"PolyMet 2015d pg. 9; SDEIS Themes FIN 04, FIN 06"
Henry V. Mott,"PolyMet’s proposed system to deal with this inevitable production of leachate - hydraulic isolation and capture for mechanical/passive treatment - relies upon the same, likely “here today and gone tomorrow”, water treatment system that is proposed to protect the environment from the acidic west pit water. The term “industry standard” is used in responses to queries by cooperating agencies to describe this set of waste rock pile reclamation measures. Here, industry standard simply means a small improvement over “business as usual” which is to excavate materials, scatter them on the Earth’s surface and leave them there with protections only as adequate as required to get through the active and near-term post mining periods. Mining’s “business as usual” practices have historically and universally resulted in severe environmental problems everywhere the mining industry has unearthed sulfide-bearing geologic formations. This waste rock pile should not be left (in any way, shape or form) strewn upon the surface of the Earth.",PD,NS,X,1,
Henry V. Mott,"PolyMet proposes to use the existing tailings impoundment created from the mining and processing of iron ores for the final disposal of its sulfide-bearing ore tailings. The reasoning set forth is that the Earth is already spoiled by this impoundment and further use, as a repository for the far-more-reactive sulfidebearing tailings simply makes sense. Here the distinction must be made that taconite tailings are virtually non-reactive, containing little if any sulfide ARD-producing or other toxics- producing mineral. The existing tailings impoundment is largely only an eyesore. Conversely, the tailings from the processing of PolyMet’s sulfide ores will potentially (and very likely) be far more reactive, containing large quantities of metals. The differences between the existing taconite tailings and the proposed sulfide ore tailings are like night and day, perhaps on the order of the chemical difference between sodium bicarbonate and sulfuric acid.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Henry V. Mott,"PolyMet’s plans include attempts to isolate the tailings from atmospheric oxygen by amending the cover with bentonite. Perhaps PolyMet’s engineers are not completely familiar with the specific properties of bentonite. Saturated bentonite (the mineral montmorillonite, most often in the sodium form) gels hold intercalated water within a layered-silicate structure. Hydrated cations and (their associated water of hydration) are held near the silicon-oxygen layers by negative charges arising from isomorphic substitution of iron (II) and magnesium for aluminum (III) in the octahedrally-coordinated inner (sandwiched between two silicon-oxygen layers) layer of the mineral. Water also bonds with the negatively charged layered structure. The immobilization of water by this bentonite gel is largely responsible for the ability of bentonite-amended soils to retard through-migration of water. The actual overall porosity of such mixtures is near that of the native soil. However, when unsaturated, the bentonite no longer retains its continuous gel properties. Then, the ability of the bentonite-amended soil to retard through-migration of gases is no better than that of the native soil. Thus, unless bentonite-modified soils are maintained in a fully-saturated state, there is no real advantage to bentonite amendment for improving transport resistance to gases. Thus, PolyMet’s proposed use of bentonite as a means to isolate the contents of the tailings impoundment from oxygen will be ineffectual. Consequently, oxygen, as a terminal electron acceptor for the sulfide to sulfate conversion process, will be present in the tailings impoundment. Infiltrating precipitation will contact the contents of the tailings impoundment and produce toxic ARD leachate.",WAT,S,N,8,"See Thematic Response WR 060-2. See PolyMet 2015d, Section 5.2.2."
Henry V. Mott,"PolyMet’s examinations of the leaching character of tailings relies upon average values of final sulfide content of tailings to make predictions of acid leaching character (RS54/RS46, 2007). Neither the ore processed for metals recovery nor the processing itself will be totally consistent so there will be perhaps large variations in the sulfide content of the tailings. PolyMet’s plan is for the taconite tailings to be a sink for acidity that might form during the mining and post-closure period. Modeling reported in RS54/RS46 is at best a scientific best guess for the behavior of the overall system.",WAT,S,N,8,"The GoldSim model utilized 216-413 weeks data from 22 PolyMet tailings humidity cells (7 fine, 14 coarse) from pilot plant runs with %S from 0.06 to 0.14 (PolyMet 2015q, Large Table 4). From these humidity cells, a sulfate release rate distribution was determined for both fine and coarse tailings (PolyMet 2015q, Large Tables 16-17). Although the current mine plan does target the average sulfur content of the tailings to be approximately 0.12 after processing, the GoldSim model does still account for variability with a distribution in sulfate release for both the fine and coarse tailings."
Henry V. Mott,"PolyMet’s plans include a system for capture of leachate from this tailings impoundment and for treatment of that leachate by the aforementioned mechanical eventually yielding to a “yet to be defined” passive treatment system. Plans call for this tailings impoundment to exist in perpetuity, which is certainly more of the same “business as usual” approach to mining wherein the tailings will simply be strewn over the Earth and left with a protective system that may or may not assimilate acid production. The emergency treatment – the water treatment facility will provide protection only as long as PolyMet has the financial will to operate and maintain it.",FIN,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes FIN 04, FIN 06"
Henry V. Mott,In the spirit of “leave no trace” PolyMet should be required to investigate incorporation of its sulfide tailings into the east/central pit backfill or perhaps the west pit backfill. Sulfide-rich conditions therein will provide absolute control on the mobility of metals that might otherwise leach from the tailings pile over the next several centuries. Long-term protection that is as risk-free as possible should be afforded Minnesota’s sensitive northern watersheds.,ALT,NS,X,1,
Henry V. Mott,"PolyMet plans to “isolate” the hydrometallurgical wastes from the environment using a 40 mil LDPE liner to prevent intrusion of rainwater and a double LDPE (80 mil and 60 mil) liner to prevent migration of leachate from the wastes into the subsurface below. Leachate formed would be collected and routed to the mechanical/passive treatment system discussed above. As with the class 1 waste rock pile, the cap would require annual maintenance to prevent woody growth and to ensure the cap remains vegetated. Of course, this liner would be subject to the same sets of environmental process as the waste rock cap. Again, PolyMet wants to assure us that this liner will isolate the contents of the hydrometallurgical waste repository from the environment in perpetuity. The same building roof argument applies here as for the waste rock pile. Eventually the cap will fail and the leachate collection system will collect leachate which will need to be treated by the water treatment system, given PolyMet has the financial will to maintain and staff the plant.",FIN,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes FIN 04, FIN 06"
Henry V. Mott,"As with the tailings, these hydrometallurgical wastes, containing large quantities of potentially toxic metals (RS33/RS65, 2007), belong isolated in pit backfill where the predominant form of sulfur will be sulfide. The sulfides of most metals (certainly those of interest here) are so insoluble that in the presence of sulfide, the aqueous concentration of the metal ion is on the order of a few molecular units per liter of water (i.e., ~10-23 molar, or, for example, in the case of copper, ~10-19 mg/L). Incorporation of these hydrometallurgical wastes into pit backfill, in the presence of an organic electron donor and sulfide minerals and with fully-saturated conditions supporting isolation by bentonite modified soils would be a very close approximation of the degree to which they are currently isolated from atmospheric oxygen in their native state.",ALT,NS,X,1,
Henry V. Mott,Leaving hydrometallurgical wastes in the system proposed by PolyMet would all but ensure a future environmental problem.,WAT,NS,X,1,
Henry V. Mott,"Certainly the technology exists to treat virtually any water, no matter how contaminated, to a level suitable for discharge to surface waters or even for consumption by humans. As contaminant levels become higher and treatment objectives become more stringent, costs increase, often exponentially. PolyMet has in its proposal suggested that reverse osmosis (RO) would be a technology of choice for treatment of pit overflow water and leachates from the waste rock pile, tailings impoundment and hydrometallurgical waste repository. Water treatment using reverse osmosis requires significant pretreatment of water otherwise RO membranes fail miserably. By and large this treatment process will require a highly sophisticated operational staff and significant financial resources for materials, supplies and plant maintenance. This is all fine and well as long as PolyMet maintains the financial will to operate the plant, which, based on PolyMet’s own predictions, will likely be needed for centuries into the future. Unfortunately, historically, the mining industry is rife with examples of mining companies that have gone “belly up” at the prospect of dealing with the messes they’ve made. One need only to do a quick internet search to inform oneself of many key instances – Brohm Mining in South Dakota, Galactic Resources in Colorado, and Pegasus Gold in Montana are three recent infamous cases. PolyMet itself is a subsidiary corporation that has been formed specifically for this project, in part to limit the liability of the parent companies and associated investors from financial risks associated with the potential failure of the project. Belief that PolyMet will be around and will have the financial will to operate this treatment system long after the profits from the mining operation have been realized and banked by CEOs, top managers, and investors is akin to adult belief in the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy. Approval of this project based on a closure strategy relying on long-term treatment of pit water and leachate will commit the State of Minnesota and its people to the very costly cleanup of this mess that PolyMet intends to make in the interests of large monetary profits for a select few and ephemeral jobs for a few more.",FIN,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes FIN 04, FIN 06"
Henry V. Mott,"I have reviewed the numerous technically based comments brought forth by cooperating agencies. Many of these mention the very points I’ve made above. By and large, PolyMet’s responses provide lip service, refer to “industry standards” or claim conformance with existing Minnesota regulations. Given that Minnesota has not yet experienced the pain associated with sulfide mining, few regulations have been developed directly pertaining to such operations. If this mining proposal is allowed to go forward with the fully inadequate provisions for post-closure environmental protection, certainly Minnesota will have opportunity to observe firsthand the adverse effects of sulfide mining upon sensitive watersheds – because an important Minnesota watershed, in the absence of significant input of Minnesota’s financial resources, will become severely adversely impacted. Would it not be prudent to learn from the experiences of others? These tough questions posed by cooperating agencies are based on the experience of others. PolyMet needs to address these questions with technical responses backed up by some prudent alterations in its post-mining closure plan.",GEN,NS,X,1,
Henry V. Mott,"Let’s consider the policy for use of Minnesota’s Boundary Waters wilderness area. The theory behind sustained use of this wonderful resource is that of “leave no trace.” If you bring it in – carry it out. If we examine the negative effects of sulfide mining in other states and in other countries, what we find is that if sulfide minerals are left by mining operations in a condition where contact with the environment is allowed, big-time problems occur. Invariably it is we the people who then must deal with the ramifications of these problems. In order to render the mining industry to be environmentally sustainable, we the people, through those we entrust with the general welfare, must hold the mining industry to a “leave no trace” standard. I call on Governor Dayton and his upper management team to be stewards of our environment not for the short-term monetary profits of a few but for the benefit of Minnesota’s posterity now and for many future generations. Let me describe one specific example of how not to proceed. The Brohm mine at the now established Gilt Edge superfund site was approved in 1987 by the SD board of Minerals and Environment as supported by the SD Department of Environment and Natural Resources on Governor George Mickelson’s watch, in the face of solid scientific evidence that mining sulfide ore using Brohm’s plan would lead to a huge environmental problem. Ten or so years into the mining operation, the environmental problems had materialized and in the face of the financial consequences, Brohm Mining, Inc. (the company incorporated to protect the parent company and investors from financial risks) declared bankruptcy. South Dakota could not afford to treat the contaminated water from the mine site let alone do the cleanup, so Bill Janklow (to the applause of those who’d profited from the mining operation) passed the problem to the EPA. The problem is now the Gilt Edge superfund site and the costs to “we the people” of the remediation of the problem will likely exceed the value of the gold recovered by the entire mining operation. Let’s not have a Berkely Pit or a Gilt Edge site in Minnesota. I have no arguments whatsoever with the environmental provision proposed during the active mining period. I believe that with significant oversight from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency as supported by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, environmental measures put in place during active mining will adequately protect the sensitive watershed within which the PolyMet site is situated. Conversely, I know that if allowed to proceed based on the currently-proposed closure/reclamation plan the PolyMet mine will be a legacy problem. I call on Governor Dayton and Minnesota’s environmental stewards to hold PolyMet to a closure/reclamation plan that leaves no sulfide bearing rock, tailings or hydrometallurgical wastes on the Earth’s surface for ultimate eventual contact with atmospheric oxygen and ultimate distribution of produced toxics to Minnesota’s waters by natural hydrologic processes. Governor Dayton and his team of high-level managers within the DNR and MPCA should individually and collectively look out for Minnesota’s resources as they would look out for their own children, perhaps holding Minnesota’s environment as closely to their hearts as they might hold an only child. We have but one environment and no risk should be considered reasonable for that environment that would not be deemed appropriate for a child. The following quote exemplifies the to-date dealings of states and the fed with mining companies: “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” Albert Einstein. How would allowing the spoiling of another of the Earth’s sensitive ecosystems in the name of corporate profits not be “insane”?",GEN,NS,X,1,

Half (33 of 67) of serious tailings dam failures in the last 70 years occurred in the 20 years between 1990 and 2009. The increasing rate of tailings dam failures is propelled by, not in spite of, modern mining practices. The increasing rate of tailings dam failures is directly related to the increasing number of TSFs (Tailings Storage Failures) larger than 5 million cubic meter capacity necessitated to allow the economic extraction of lower grades of ore. 11 catastrophic failures are predicted globally from 2010 to 2019. Predicted total cost of these 11 failures is approximately $6 billion. The average cost of these catastrophic tailings dam failures is $543 million. Regulator attempts to recoup cleanup costs from mining operators reveal — through court records and other official documents — dollar totals for cleanup and recovery. Mining companies cannot afford, and cannot secure insurance to cover, the costs of catastrophic failures: Losses, both economic and ecological, are in large part either permanent and non-recoverable, or recovery — to the extent physically possible — are funded by public monies.",GT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes GT 01, FIN 08"

W. Charles Huskins,"Nonetheless, based on careful review, I have concluded the assessment of the environment impacts of the project as they relate to human health is inadequate for the following reasons.",GEN,NS,X,1,
W. Charles Huskins,"Please note that my comments, as listed below, were previously made in response to the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) in 2014. I find no record, either in the text of the FEIS or in Appendix A, Response to Comments on the DEIS for the NorthMet Mining Project and SDEISA for the NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange (specifically Section A.5.11), that these critiques have been addressed.",MEPA,S,N,5,Human Health Theme Responses App A.
W. Charles Huskins,"Comment 1: The FEIS provides an extremely limited assessment of the impact of the project on human health. In a document over 3500 pages in length, the FEIS devotes only 5 pages (7-13 to 7-18) to a summary of the impact of the project on human health. The impact of the project on human health is particularly important because the FEIS acknowledges that the baseline community health in Lake and St. Louis counties is already “poor relative to other counties in Minnesota” (Page 7-14).",HU,NS,X,1,
W. Charles Huskins,"Comment 2: The FEIS does not fully acknowledge vulnerable human populations affected by the environmental impacts of the project. The FEIS acknowledges children as an important component of the human population affected by the project (EO 13045 Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks, 1997, Page 5-590). In addition, the FEIS states “Children (individuals under 18 years of age) comprise nearly 29 percent of the study area population, compared to 24 percent for the state” (Page 5-590). However, the FEIS does not acknowledge pregnant women or their unborn fetuses are a vulnerable population with respect to methylmercury exposure. In fact, in a document over 3500 pages in length, the FEIS does not even mention pregnant women or fetuses. The only mention of issues related to the health of pregnant women occurs in Attachment 3, which describes the Tribal Collaborative Agencies Cumulative Effects Analysis. In addition, because mercury accumulates and persists in the human body, all women with childbearing potential (not just pregnant women) should be considered a vulnerable population. This is a major omission because developing fetuses are highly susceptible to neurotoxicity caused by exposure to methylmercury. In addition, the SDEIS does not acknowledge that elderly adults are another vulnerable population with respect to methylmercury exposure. Persons >65 years of age represent a fifth of the populations Lake and St. Louis counties and the FEIS states that the study communities have “more senior citizens (age 65 or older) than the state as a whole” (Page 4-372). Yet, the FEIS does not even mention health risks for elderly persons. This is a major omission because elderly persons may be at increased risk to the effects of methylmercury due to reduced metabolism of toxic compounds, neurologic co-morbidities, a higher pre-existing load of mercury in their bodies, and increased consumption of contaminated fish.",HU,S,N,6,SDEIS Theme HU 02
W. Charles Huskins,"Comment 3: The FEIS does not adequately address the impact of methylmercury exposure on human health, particularly the health of vulnerable populations. The FEIS acknowledges that methylmercury has serious adverse effects on human health, including neurotoxicity. The FEIS assessment of the impact of increased exposure to methylmercury on human health is inadequate for the following reasons. A. As noted in Comment 2, the FEIS does not even mention sizable proportions of the population that may be particularly vulnerable to methylmercury exposure. As a consequence, the FEIS does not address the impacts of methylmercury exposure on high-risk populations (e.g., children, pregnant women and fetuses, the elderly), which are likely to differ from the impact on the population as a whole. B. The FEIS uses the “Hazard Quotient”, which is “the ratio of the mercury concentration in fish to a health-based target of 0.2 ppm” (Page 6-86) to quantify the potential impact of the exposure to methylmercury on human health. The FEIS states “a Hazard Quotient greater than 1 exceeds the health-based target” (Page 6-86). However, the FEIS does not provide evidence that the Hazard Quotient is an accurate measure of the effect of exposure to methylmercury on human health. Moreover, it does not state whether a Hazard Quotient threshold of 1 is applicable to all segments of the population, particularly vulnerable populations (see Comment 3.A). C. The FEIS estimates the “maximum incremental cumulative Hazard Quotient from the two projects over existing fish mercury concentrations is 0.08 for recreational anglers, 0.61 for subsistence/tribal anglers, and 0.54 for subsistence fishers.” The FEIS further states that the “NorthMet Project Proposed Action contributes approximately 59 to 92 percent of the incremental cumulative Hazard Quotient.” (Page 6-86).” Accepting the premise that a Health Quotient greater than 1 exceeds the health-based target (see Comment 3.B), a mere two-fold increase in this estimate would indicate that the project will have a substantial effect on the health of humans who are subsistence or tribal anglers. Moreover, this is likely to be a significant underestimate of the risk to large portions of the population—that is, the vulnerable populations identified previously (see Comments 2, 3.A, and 3.B).",HU,S,N,8,"SDEIS Themes AQ 03, HU 02"
W. Charles Huskins,"To address my comments above, I recommend the parties involved in the development of the FEIS take the following actions and revise the FEIS accordingly. 1.

Given that existing levels of mercury contamination of water resources and fish are above acceptable levels, acknowledge that incremental increases in sulfate or mercury concentrations of water resources represent adverse impacts of the project. 3. Provide evidence that the Hazard Quotient is a precise and accurate assessment of the impact of methylmercury exposure on human health, including vulnerable populations (see Comments 2, 3.B, and 3.C).

This result is directly contrary to the United States Forest Service (""USFS"") goals for the Superior National Forest of restoring long-lived conifer species and maintaining and increasing older forest growth stages.6 Three at risk native plant communities occur within the federal lands: jack pine-black spruce woodland, white pinered pine forest, and rich black spruce swamp. The jack pine-black spruce woodland makes up a large proportion of the 1, 172.5 acres of upland conifer forest on federal lands, and much of this occurs in large (> 100 acres) intact patches. A complex of large patches of rare plant communities such as jack pine-black spruce woodland provide critical habitat for conifer dependent species. It is generally accepted that the proportion of such large forest patches has declined dramatically in the past century resulting in a loss of critical habitat.7 In the Laurentian Uplands Subsection, 35 birds that are Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) and are associated with upland conifer habitats. Increasing the area of rare native plant communities is stated as a desired vegetation condition for the Superior National Forest. 8 The FEIS acknowledges these losses but fails to develop or address an alternative that will compensate the federal estate. The habitats lost are critical, rare, and difficult to replace, home to a number of SGCN species, and important to the Superior National Forest vegetation objectives.9 Therefore, the FEIS fails to discuss an alternative with appropriate mitigation measures for these losses, does not respond to substantive comments asking for compensation for the loss and should be found inadequate.",ALT,S,N,8,"The Land Exchange evaluated a range of alternatives, one of which, the No Action Alternative, results in no critical habitat loss. The two other alternatives evaluated disclose a range of potential impacts if the Proposed Action were to be approved. This alternatives analysis satisfies environmental review requirements. FEIS 5.3.4, Appendix D."
Maya Batres,"The Land Exchange described in the FEIS fails to compensate for the loss of ecosystem services, including loss of carbon storage contributing to climate change, as required by United States Forest Service Planning Rules and a Presidential Memorandum. The proposed Land Exchange will result in a significant loss of ecosystem services associated with a large intact wetland-upland complex. Services lost include carbon storage and watershed and habitat function. However, these services are not considered in the FEIS. The failure to account for ecosystem services is not compliant with the 2012 USFS Planning Rule and as recently directed by Presidential Memorandum. It is also not responsive to the Conservancy's substantive comments about the loss of peatland systems and key ecosystem services. Under the proposed Land Exchange there will be a loss of 2,163 acres of northern peatlands from the federal estate of which 1,961 acres are conifer bog and 202 acres are open bog. Northern peatlands have the highest carbon density of any ecosystem and thus retaining intact peatlands is critical in this era of climate change. Carbon storage is one of the many important ecosystem services provided by wetland systems, peatlands in particular. Therefore, loss to the federal estate of 2, 163 acres of peatlands represents a significant decrease in a key ecosystem service that is not accounted for in the Land Exchange. The FEIS states that 83% of the impacts to conifer bogs would be mitigated through offsite restoration projects. This figure does not take into consideration the substantial uncertainly in the success rate of peatland restoration or the losses during the time lag before restoration is complete. Further, the FEIS presents an optimistic view of the likely success of peatland restoration, when in reality there is little evidence of long-term success in restoring functioning ecosystems with peat accumulation. The FEIS does present methods that show promise for successful restoration including hydrologic restoration and reintroducing Sphagnum moss species. However, it will likely require 20-30 years just to determine whether peat accumulation is occurring. Since peat accumulates very slowly at rates of 0.5-1 mm/year, compensating for carbon lost on the project site may require several centuries. Longer term monitoring is needed to determine if restoration projects can lead to functioning peatlands that provide the same ecosystem services as natural systems. 14 Even if these efforts at peatland restoration were successful, the carbon lost through direct impacts at the project site would not be replaced during the lifetime of the mine due to the slow accumulation of organic matter in peatland systems. As a result, the FEIS is inadequate for its failure to address the loss of peatland systems and the key ecosystem service of carbon storage provided by the peatlands in the proposed Land Exchange, and its failure to develop an alternative with appropriate mitigation which fully compensates for the loss of these ecosystem services. II. Summary of Necessary Action on the Land Exchange. 1. The FEIS should include an alternative providing additional land in the Land Exchange to compensate for critical habitat losses to the Superior National Forest, including mature upland conifer forest, forest in long rotation classification , and imperiled and at-risk native plant communities. 2. The FEIS should accurately describe the loss of ecosystem services provided by peatlands including carbon storage and watershed and habitat function. 3. The FEIS should include a Land Exchange alternative that fully compensate for the loss of ecosystem services, especially carbon storage.",O,S,N,8,"The FEIS responds to The Nature Conservancy's comments regarding impacts to peatlands in the responses to SDEIS Themes VEG 02, VEG 03, VEG 05, WET 01, WET 03, WET 04."
Maya Batres,"The FEIS is inadequate because its analysis of wetlands and mitigation does not propose meaningful mitigation alternatives that sufficiently compensate for losses and satisfy the Federal Mitigation Rule. A. Direct wetland loss from the Proposed Action is a substantial and serious environmental impact and occurs disproportionately among wetlands designated as high quality and difficult to replace. As documented in the FEIS, at least 913 acres of wetlands will be directly affected and permanently lost, representing nearly 60% of all wetlands in the project area. If approved, the wetland loss would be one of the largest permitted losses in Minnesota history. Of the impacted acres, 59% of the wetlands are lowland conifer and bog type wetlands that are highly sensitive; provide critical habitat for declining and iconic species such as moose, Species of Greatest Conservation Need (""SGCN"") such as Connecticut warblers, boreal chickadees, rusty blackbirds, olive-sided flycatchers, disa alpine and bog copper butterflies, and northern bog lemmings; and provide many other important functions for water, wildlife and ecosystems. Of the nearly 760 acres of wetlands that will be destroyed at the mine site, 92% of these are identified in the FEIS as ""High Quality"" and are mapped by the state as areas of High Biodiversity Significance. From the perspective of the Conservancy, this loss of wetlands represents a serious and extensive impact to the state's natural resources. 16 In our previous comments on the SDEIS and reiterated in Section 1 above, the Conservancy emphasized that lowland conifer and bog wetlands are difficult to replace, and that restoration of degraded wetlands like these have a poor track record of success. Indeed, bogs and fens are specifically identified in federal regulations as ""difficult to replace resources,"" warranting special consideration in wetland mitigation. While the FEIS highlights new techniques for potentially improving the success of restoration and has incorporated some of these techniques into mitigation plans, their actual track record of success for these techniques is still lacking. This uncertainty as to whether the substantial and serious environmental impacts to wetlands can be mitigated warrants greater caution, skepticism of optimistic claims of success, and both regulatory and financial safety nets for wetland mitigation.",WET,S,N,11,Application of appropriate federal regulations relative to mitigation occur during the 404 permitting process.
Maya Batres,"A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( ""Corps"") regulatory requirement, reinforced by a recent Presidential Memorandum, states ""[f]or difficult-to-replace resources (e.g., bogs, fens, springs, streams, Atlantic white cedar swamps), if further avoidance and minimization is not practicable, the required compensation should be provided, if practicable, through in-kind rehabilitation, enhancement, or preservation since there is greater certainty that these methods of compensation will successfully offset permitted impacts."" The FEIS focuses solely on in-kind rehabilitation, the most uncertain, and historically least successful, of the three allowable approaches. Similar to an investment portfolio, where risk is spread among different kinds of financial instruments, a successful ""mitigation portfolio"" should include a range of actions. The portfolio should include a mix of sites and approaches, ranging from relatively risky wetland rehabilitation to lower risk preservation of unprotected wetlands. For these kinds of wetlands, it is important to recognize that mitigation is not likely to restore all lost functions and that restoring wetland functions of any kind will take considerable time. Thus additional regulatory and financial safeguards are needed in the event that one or more mitigation site does not or cannot attain success criteria. Although the FEIS commits to a 2:1 replacement ratio for a relatively small acreage (7 .6 acres) of directly impacted, open bog wetlands, the 1.58:1 replacement ratio identified for the much greater acreage (537.6 acres) of lowland conifer/forested bog wetlands is inadequate compensation for such sensitive and difficult to replace wetlands. The replacement ratio could and should be greater. The St. Paul District of the Corps' policy on mitigation provides for a case-by-case determination of compensation ratios for impacted wetlands that are difficult to replace or wetlands that provide an ""exceptional level of functions"". Arguably, the impacted wetlands for the proposed action fit into this category, as noted in Section 1 of our comments, and therefore, gives the District Engineer discretion to determine the compensation ratio with no specified maximum. State law also provides a similar authority if proposed actions will permanently and adversely affect wetlands that contain rare natural communities or sites mapped as Outstanding or High Biodiversity. When the success of mitigation is uncertain, as is the case here, and the affected wetlands are rare, difficult-to-replace or provide exceptional values, both the state and the Corps have the authority to require financial assurance, separate from that needed for mine construction, operation, closure and reclamation. The Corps' policy allows the agency to require financial assurance to ensure that compensatory mitigation is successfully implemented and permit conditions are satisfied in the event of unforeseen circumstances. Minnesota statute also allows financial assurance for wetland mitigation. The FEIS is silent as to the amount of financial assurance needed for mitigation and not responsive to previous comments on this issue by the Conservancy and others. Given the uncertainty of restoration success, the Conservancy reiterates its previous comments that financial assurance for mitigation should be set forth in the FEIS. The Corps' own guidance states that ""the District Engineer shall require sufficient financial assurances to ensure a high level of confidence that the mitigation project will be successfully completed, in accordance with applicable performance standards,"" and notes that such assurance is needed, among other things: a. To correct or replace unsuccessful mitigation if [the] responsible party is unwilling/unable to do so; b. To allow permit issuance using permittee-responsible mitigation prior to successful mitigation implementation. The same guidance also recommends that financial assurance amounts for mitigation be sufficient to cover the full costs (including land costs) to complete the work and meet all applicable performance standards at an alternate site by a third party. An example of this would be to set aside in an appropriate financial vehicle the total cost of purchasing credits in an established mitigation bank in the same service area.27 In light of the fact that the directly affected wetlands are of high biodiversity significance, provide exceptional levels of functions, are difficult to replace, and will be permanently destroyed, the FEIS must place greater emphasis on avoiding and minimizing impacts to high quality wetlands, make a commitment to a higher replacement ratio, and provide separate financial assurance to cover the costs of this long-term and highly uncertain wetlands mitigation.",WET,S,O,11,Final mitigation ratios will be determined prior to the USACE ROD.
Maya Batres,"In the FEIS, three mitigation sites are proposed, two in the Mississippi River basin outside of the impacted watershed and one in the St. Louis River watershed nearly 50 miles from the Proposed Project area. Approximately 70% .of the total proposed mitigation acres are located outside the impacted watershed, representing a net loss of wetlands and their functions from the St. Louis River watershed, which has already lost 15% of its historic wetlands. 28 The proposed mitigation sites are presented in the FEIS as a fait accompli, long ago selected and decided, with no alternatives provided for public review and comment. The FEIS admits that these sites were selected using criteria developed prior to the 2008 Federal Mitigation Rule, 29 which strongly encourages the use of a watershed approach for site selection. Given the length of time it took to develop the SDEIS, which was released almost six years after the 2008 rule, there was plenty of time to develop a watershed approach to site selection. In addition to a watershed approach, Corps' regulations also require specific consideration of in-watershed mitigation options as a priority for mitigation. However, the FEIS ignored these long standing principles for in-watershed mitigation and the newer watershed approach rule and moved forward with the previously determined mitigation sites without public review and comment. The Conservancy provided detailed comments on wetland mitigation in the SDEIS and called for greater emphasis on in-kind, in-watershed wetland restoration, enhancement and preservation. The proposed wetland mitigation in the FEIS is essentially unchanged from that in the SDEIS. We continue to express concern about locking into years-old mitigation solutions identified and developed in a prior era of wetland mitigation policy, and we encourage sufficient financial and operational flexibility in the FEIS to make use of improved in- watershed options as they emerge, including the purchase of mitigation bank credits. Based on the failure of the FEIS to respond to these comments, the FEIS is inadequate and must address our concerns about the wetland mitigation favoring out-of-watershed replacement, focusing on sites selected under a long out-of-date policy, and providing no meaningful alternatives for public review and comment.",WET,S,N,8,A final decision on wetland mitigation including ratios will be made during the 404 permitting process. The FEIS is not inadequate because it does not resolve what USACE permitting conditions are.
Maya Batres,"In the FEIS, there is no commitment to advance mitigation for indirect impacts to wetlands. Instead, it proposes monitoring changes in hydrology, vegetation and other indicators for the wetlands in places where indirect impacts are expected to occur. Although it acknowledges that mitigation may be required, no mitigation plans will be developed until after impacts are detected. Using a monitoring approach to determine whether mitigation is needed is insufficient for several reasons. First, the kinds of indirect impacts identified in the FEIS, especially those caused by groundwater drawdown, are reasonably foreseeable and permanent: the technical literature from across the U.S. leaves little doubt that such impacts are not only possible, but likely. Second, wetland monitoring programs established for regulatory purposes have a poor track record of being able to detect impacts before they occur. In many instances, such monitoring programs have been insensitive to impacts even after they started to occur, leading to uncertainty and dispute about the cause of the impacts until damage is already severe or irreversible. Finally, allowing impacts to occur before requiring mitigation contradicts the Corps' governing mitigation principles that ""[i]mplementation of the compensatory mitigation project shall be, to the maximum extent practicable, in advance of or concurrent with the activity causing the authorized impacts."" This situation may result in a loss of wetland function during the time between detecting impacts and mitigating for them, a contradiction to the no-net-loss policy that governs mitigation under both state and federal law. The FEIS is inadequate due to its failure to respond to concerns about the lack of advance mitigation for foreseeable, permanent indirect impacts to wetlands. These indirect impacts will have an effect on an estimated 6,500 to 7,700 additional acres, acreage over and above the 913 acres directly impacted and previously addressed in these comments. While the FEIS does commit to advance mitigation for 26.9 acres of impacts from wetland fragmentation, this still leaves a substantial amount of impacted acreage uncompensated. By not providing mitigation until impacts are detected, there is a high likelihood that a temporal loss of wetland function could occur. II. Summary of Necessary Action on Wetlands and Mitigation.1. Meaningful alternatives should be developed for mitigating wetland impacts that include different combinations of in-kind restoration, enhancement and preservation, and alternative options for mitigation sites that satisfy the selection criteria set forth in the Federal Mitigation Rule including permanent protection of wetlands within the St. Louis River watershed. 2. Mitigation for all direct and indirect impacts to all bog, fen and lowland conifer wetland types should be developed using replacement ratios of at least 2: 1. 3. Financial assurance estimates for mitigation of direct and indirect wetland impacts should be developed and financial assurance should be required in an amount sufficient to cover full costs to complete the work and meet all applicable performance standards at alternative sites by a third party. 4. An explicit commitment should be made and plans should be developed for advance mitigation of all reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts to wetlands identified in the FEIS. 5. As part of the EIS process, the agencies should solicit and consider public comment on mitigation alternatives and plans, including those for indirect impacts, and on financial assurance for ensuring success of mitigation for direct and indirect impacts.",WET,S,O,11,SDEIS Theme COE 02
Maya Batres,"The FEIS is inadequate because it fails to substantively respond to comments establishing the need for the inclusion of an Ecological Risk Assessment. A. Sound engineering practice requires a risk assessment as an essential element of project design. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) asserts that ""effective risk characterization and management is fundamental to engineering.""35 The ASCE makes a point of distinguishing between risk assessment, which is used to characterize risks (both likely and unlikely); risk analysis, which ranks the relative risks of a specific system; and risk management, which is an approach for weighing and mitigating risks. 36 The FEIS does not include a risk assessment or risk analysis. Rather, the FEIS references the Adaptive Water Management Plan (AWMP) for its discussion of risk. The AWMP, while ostensibly a tool for risk management, does not include nor address the fundamental need for characterizing the risks it purports to manage. To be effective, risk management should come only after a thorough risk assessment and risk analysis have been completed. The failure to include a risk assessment in the FEIS denies decisionmakers and the public vital information necessary to evaluate the potential environmental consequences of this project. For a project whose environmental impacts will extend centuries beyond its projected twenty-year operational phase, ignoring this step could result in serious environmental consequences that are not characterized or evaluated in the FEIS. ) The FEIS acknowledges that the proposed mine will produce pollution that could potentially impact water quality for centuries. In response to this environmental threat, the FEIS anticipates near-perpetual operation of the tailings dam and water containment, collection, and treatment systems. Given the expected centuries of operation, there is a substantial risk that one or more of these engineered systems will fail due to natural causes; equipment malfunction, breakage, or age; human error; or lack of funds for maintenance and repair. In light of this risk, the Conservancy and others have urged the agencies to provide a risk assessment of the project in the FEIS. Such a risk assessment would include the probability and environmental consequences of potential failures for each of the following aspects during all phases of the project: the mine site, plant site, transportation corridor, tailings basins, stockpiles, and water containment and treatment systems (hereinafter referred to as ""Ecological Risk Assessment""). 8. An Ecological Risk Assessment is an essential and feasible element of the FEIS. As discussed above, a risk assessment is considered a fundamental engineering practice. The ASCE has noted that it is important, ""to adequately address risk in how systems are planned and designed and how consequences are managed"", and ""urges government agencies and private entities at all levels to incorporate risk management in all decision-making processes.""37 The ASCE goes on to say that ""risk management practices must be clearly communicated to the public"" including encouraging and facilitating public participation in review of risk assessment procedures. 38 The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Bristol Bay Assessment demonstrates the feasibility of producing an Ecological Risk Assessment for a large, complex open pit mine at a level of detail sufficient for inclusion in an EIS.39 The assessment, which the USEPA prepared recently for the proposed copper mine in Bristol Bay, Alaska, uses historical evidence to assess the probability of failure over time for the engineered systems commonly found at mines40 and the expected environmental consequences of such failures. In addition to using historic evidence, the assessment also considers future risks from current mines that are designed using state-of-the-practice engineering.41 Because the Proposed Project relies on these same types of engineered systems to protect surface and groundwater quality, the Conservancy and others have called for the inclusion of a similar Ecological Risk Assessment here. By including an assessment in the FEIS, the public would then be afforded the opportunity to review and comment on how risk and environmental consequences compare among alternatives. It would be straightforward to update and adapt the EPA's Bristol Bay analysis, apply it to the Proposed Project, and then use it to determine the consequences and costs of potential system failures. However, the FEIS does not include a risk assessment of any kind and implies that the engineered environmental safeguards will flawlessly perform in perpetuity. This implicit use of a ""best case"" scenario .. . 'skews' the data toward fewer environmental impacts and thus impedes a 'full and fair discussion of the potential effects of the project.'42 To avoid such an unwarranted skewing of the analysis, the FEIS should include an Ecological Risk Assessment to inform the agencies and the public about the long term environmental consequences of the mine.43 In the response to comments asking for a risk assessment, the FEIS dismisses the request and merely responds that ""[n]either NEPA nor MEPA. ... requires the evaluation of worst-case or failure event scenarios.""44 This answer is non-responsive: commenters were not asking for a ""worst case analysis"", but a realistic risk assessment that could ""generate information and discussion. of those consequences of greatest concern to the public and greatest relevance to the agency decision ... rather than overemphasizing speculative harms.""45",O,S,O,8,An ERA was considered and not screened into the EIS. The FEIS adequately describes the risk to the environment. The FEIS is complete.
Maya Batres,"Environmental regulations support the inclusion of an Ecological Risk Assessment as an essential element of determining the environmental consequences of the Proposed Action. Environmental regulations support including a risk assessment in the FEIS. A fundamental requirement of any environmental impact statement is to ""rigorously explore and objectively evaluate"" the environmental consequences of the proposed action, including its direct and indirect effects.46 Indirect effects are those which are caused by the Proposed Action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable. 47 Reasonably foreseeable effects include not only those effects where there is a significant risk of their occurrence48 but also those ""impacts which have catastrophic consequences, even if their probability of occurrence is low."" Over the centuries during which the engineered systems at NorthMet must operate, it is ""reasonably foreseeable"" that the systems will fail and pose significant adverse consequences to surface and groundwater quality. As documented in the Bristol Bay Assessment, failures of water collection, transport, and treatment systems are fairly common occurrences at mines during their operation and post-closure periods, and become ever more likely the longer they are required to perform. The Bristol Bay Assessment also finds that while tailings basin failures may have a low probability of occurrence, a tailings basin failure could result in a greatly degraded habitat for decades. The catastrophic failure of the tailings dam at the Mt. Polley Mine in 2014 is a recent example of a low-probability, high consequence failure that could have been prepared for if risks had been adequately characterized and then mitigated as part of the planning, design, and environmental review process. 51 Both the Bristol Bay Assessment and Mt. Polley case show the need to fully assess the risks associated with mining because the potential failures of the engineered systems and their environmental consequences are ""reasonably foreseeable"" and therefore must be rigorously analyzed in the FEIS. Federal regulations require that ""[i]f the incomplete information relevant to a reasonably foreseeable significant impact is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and the overall costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant, the agency shall include the information in the environmental impact statement.""52 Here, a risk assessment is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives since it provides important information about the likelihood and size of ""reasonably foreseeable"" impacts to surface waters and groundwater over the centuries-long duration of the Proposed Action. 53 Moreover, development of a risk assessment is reasonably obtainable and neither exorbitantly nor excessively costly because the time and money has already been spent developing data and an assessment for Bristol Bay that is readily-adaptable for use here. Due to the un-assessed risks posed by the Proposed Action-both the common risks of failure of the water collection, transport, and treatment system and the catastrophic risk of a tailings dam failure a rigorous Environmental Risk Assessment should be included in the FEIS and an opportunity for public comment on the assessment should be provided.",O,S,O,8,An ERA was considered and not screened into the EIS. The FEIS adequately describes the risk to the environment. The FEIS is complete.
Maya Batres,"An Adaptive Water Management Plan does not compensate for the lack of an Ecological Risk Assessment. As an alternative to an Ecological Risk Assessment, the FEIS claims that the NorthMet Project Adaptive Water Management Plan (AWMP)55 is sufficient to address future negative impacts on water quality. However, the AWMP is largely a plan describing engineering monitoring and controls that will be in place to detect and manage the environmental impacts to water quality as they arise; i.e. a risk management approach, not a risk assessment. Also, there is nothing in the AWMP to address the severe consequences of a tailings dam failure. In effect, the AWMP proposes how one might respond to a failure, rather than informing decision-makers and the public of the nature of all risks in advance of approving the project. Asserting that problems will be detected and addressed as they arise is no substitute for a rigorous, transparent Ecological Risk Assessment of systems that could fail and the consequences that would follow. Relying on risk management procedures alone, rather than accurately characterizing risks and consequences is similar to the situation that occurred at the Mt. Polley Mine. There, the independent review panel investigating the disaster wrote that ""[mitigating risk of tailings basin failure] was contingent on consistently flawless execution in planning, in subsurface investigation, in analysis and design, in construction quality, in operational diligence, in monitoring, in regulatory actions, and in risk management at every level. All of these activities are subject to human error.""56 Without an assessment of the probability and consequences of risks associated with the potential human and natural causes of engineered systems failures, the FEIS similarly assumes a flawless performance of these engineered systems over centuries and thus fails to provide a reasoned evaluation of the environmental consequences of the proposed mine. II. Summary of Necessary Action on Risk Assessment 1 . The FEIS should include a thorough Ecological Risk Assessment adapting the approach used by the USEPA for Bristol Bay to characterize risks of failure and their environmental consequences.",O,S,O,8,An ERA was considered and not screened into the EIS. The FEIS adequately describes the risk to the environment. The FEIS is complete.
Maya Batres,"The FEIS is inadequate because it does not thoroughly develop and examine the size or mechanism for financial assurances and does not substantively respond to comments establishing the need for the inclusion of financial assurance in the FEIS. A. The FEIS fails to provide thorough documentation of the cost estimates underlying the financial assurance and to provide an opportunity for public comment. Serious risks to the environment are associated with the reclamation, closure, and the perpetual operation and maintenance of treatment systems and engineered structures. To minimize the risk that there will be inadequate funds to protect environmental resources in perpetuity, it is critical to develop robust financial assurances and for them to be carefully scrutinized by state and federal agencies and the public. It is well documented that mines frequently fail, go bankrupt and are abandoned. As a result of this financial failure risk, the probability of hazardous substance releases and the severity of the consequences associated with such releases, mines are the highest priority category for development of financial assurances under the Superfund program. 58 The financial risk of mine failure is not merely a documented historical fact but remains an issue today, as underscored by the recent financial reports about Glencore, a major financial backer of Proposed Project. Low copper prices and extremely high debt loads have caused a huge fall in the market value of Glencore's stock and triggered renewed concern about its ability to sustain its financial commitments. As the USEPA has noted with respect to the NEPA reviews of proposed mines, ""the amount and viability of financial assurances are critical factors in determining the effectiveness of reclamation and closure activities and, therefore, the significance of environmental impacts. This is particularly important when long-term water management and treatment will be needed."" Thus, as with an Ecological Risk Assessment, it is essential that the FEIS thoroughly develop and examine a financial assurance package in order to realistically assess the environmental consequences of the proposed mine during its operation, closure and reclamation, and post-closure periods. In response to the Conservancy's detailed comments on financial assurances, the FEIS simply states that a thorough analysis of financial assurance is not possible due to a lack of detailed engineering plans and that such plans will be provided during the permit to mine process (i.e., after the completion of the EIS process). The response is contradictory: the engineering plans for the Proposed Action are put forth as sufficiently developed for the FEIS to analyze environmental consequences while lacking the detail to allow analysis of the expenses associated with these consequences. At least equally important, the development of this information would be relatively straightforward and not excessively or exorbitantly costly. According to press reports, the applicant is prepared to file its application for the permit to mine, along with its detailed engineering plans, in February or as soon as the state EIS process is complete. Additionally, if the reason for excluding financial assurance were based on the exorbitant cost or lack of information, the FEIS should have claimed the exception from providing such information as provided for under federal law. Therefore, the purported lack of detailed plans at this time is hollow and non-responsive to comments. The FEIS has not developed any additional information, analysis, or justification for the cursory financial assurance estimate prepared by the applicant's consultant in 2013. The general summary of costs, cited in Foth 2013, provides scant information on the amount necessary for protection of the environment and the public. Foth 2013 provides no explanation of how these general costs were derived, no description for the amount of individual cost components, and no discussion about the appropriate size of the contingency for the perpetual operation and maintenance activity of the proposed action.64 Instead, the FEIS indicates that any additional information on financial assurances will be developed during the permit-to-mine process, which is not anticipated until after the conclusion of the FEIS process. When this critical information is developed, the adequacy of the FEIS will have been determined and the public will hot have an opportunity to comment on this project's impact on public resources.65 In effect, the FEIS will deny the public a meaningful opportunity to comment on this critical element of the Proposed Project and its impact on the environment, contrary to the principles of NEPA and the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act.66 For these reasons, the EIS document should provide detailed financial assurance information, assess its impacts on environmental resources, and make that information and analysis available for public comment.",FIN,S,O,8,See SDEIS Theme FIN 03. The EIS appropriately discloses financial assurance requirements should the project be permitted.  The State of Minnesota rules governing the Permit to Mine permit process require a comment period when additional details on financial assurance would be disclosed to the public for review.
Maya Batres,"8. The FEIS fails to provide a detailed risk assessment - a necessary component when developing a financial assurance plan. As discussed in Section 3, the FEIS fails to include an Ecological Risk Assessment, a vital factor in developing a contingency amount for an adequate financial assurance package. The FEIS simply dismisses the need for such an assessment and the applicability of a similar assessment to the one for the proposed Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay, Alaska.67 The FEIS claims that ""the referenced document does not address any specific mining proposal and thus cannot appropriately be applied to the North Met Project Proposed Action.""68 This dismissal is nonresponsive to the Conservancy's and others' comments: the fact that there was no specific mining proposal at Bristol Bay has no bearing on the direct relevance of such an assessment to the Proposed Action. If anything, the fact that a risk assessment could be performed in the absence of an EIS or permit application at Bristol Bay, should make it easier, more relevant, and more practical to perform a similar assessment on this developed Proposed Project, especially if it will aid in the development of a complete financial assurance plan.69 Equally important, this dismissal ignores the basic point of the comment. For projects with extremely long or perpetual timeframes for operation and maintenance, it is critical to perform an Ecological Risk Assessment in order to realistically estimate the size of the contingency which must be covered by the financial assurance. The EPA Bristol Bay analysis provides an example and recent data on the frequency and types of mine failures, which is exactly the kind of analysis needed here where the operation, maintenance and monitoring of engineered systems may be required in perpetuity. This analysis and data is not only reasonably obtainable and not excessively costly, it is available, current, and easily adapted to this situation. Under such circumstances, it is critical and feasible for the FEIS to include an Ecological Risk Assessment for this project to ensure a finished financial assurance package capable of covering the cost of a potential system failure.",O,S,O,8,An ERA was considered and not screened into the EIS. The FEIS adequately describes the risk to the environment. The FEIS is complete.
Maya Batres,"The FEIS fails to provide a mechanism of financial assurance that will remain effective and fully payable in perpetuity. As advocated in previous comments on the SDEIS, 90% or more of the financial assurance should be in the form of a fully- funded trust fund, particularly for long term operation, maintenance and monitoring of the site, including the tailings basin and water treatment systems. The FEIS did not substantively respond to these comments and simply reiterated the types of mechanisms which might be available for projects with shorter operation and maintenance periods. Neither did it identify or justify the specific mechanism to be used here either for short term or long term activities. The FEIS thus failed to adequately respond to the assertion in previous comments that all of the third party mechanisms for financial assurance (e.g., surety bond, letter of credit, insurance, parent guarantee) will not be sufficient to cover long-term operation, maintenance and monitoring in the event of PolyMet's insolvency. As noted in an analysis of financial assurances for mine reclamation and closure, ""[w]here closure costs are long term (in many water treatment situations, costs are ""in perpetuity""), forms of cash such as trust funds are the only practical way to provide a financial guarantee.""70 Most of the non-trust fund/third party mechanisms referenced in the FEIS typically have tailored terms which specify when payment under the mechanism is required, and would be unsuitable as financial assurance for the Proposed Project due to the likelihood of disputes and litigation with the third party over the applicability of these terms. Moreover, many of these mechanisms are written on an annual or short term basis with the possibility of cancellation and the need for renewal. If PolyMet or its successors finds itself under financial pressure it is unlikely that a third party provider would renew the mechanism because of the high likelihood of a substantial loss Given the FEIS's failure to adopt the fully-funded trust fund as the primary mechanism for financial assurance of long term activities, the FEIS provides inadequate financial assurance for the project, for perpetual maintenance after closure and for the environment in perpetuity. II. Summary of Necessary Action on Financial Assurance The FEIS should complete this analysis and provide a detailed financial assurance package which includes, at a minimum, the following : 1.

The documentation should identify each individual component of cost; disclose the assumptions and sources utilized in deriving each individual component; and include a contingency amount for unanticipated costs. 2. The FEIS should use an Ecological Risk Assessment as a basis for determining critical elements of financial assurance, for calculating the amounts needed for an adequate contingency, and for determining the appropriate assurance mechanism. 3. The FEIS should provide financial assurances that will remain effective and fully payable in perpetuity, the majority of which should be a fully-funded trust fund. 4.

Frank Ongaro,"First, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U. S. Forest Service put forth an exceptional amount of dedication and due diligence in reviewing and analyzing the FEIS. The review and analysis was accomplished in a thoughtful, deliberate and thorough process involving many stakeholders, including members of the public, the business community and state, local and federal governmental units. The FEIS analyzed the required topics identified in the original scoping documents, as well as other topics that were identified in both the public comment period and environmental review process.",MEPA,NS,X,1,
Frank Ongaro,"Second, air and water quantity, and potential human health effects of the proposed project were all identified and analyzed in the FEIS. The project's water modeling, which was fully updated for the Final EIS, shows that PolyMet's treatment and mitigation plans will prevent acid mine drainage and meet all water quality standards. Specific attention was paid to the human health impacts of the project. The addition of the new section that concisely analyzed the human health impacts and addressed concerns raised by the Department of Health and others during the public comment period are a positive contribution to the report. The final analysis ultimately identified no adverse health risks. Water quality modeling and monitoring information at the mine and plant sites that also included mitigation and analysis of the potential for northward flow of groundwater are also supplements to the FEIS that addressed many concerns in the comment process. The final analysis shows that all of the concerns regarding these topics and others were more than adequately addressed in modeling and analytical discussions.",MEPA,NS,X,1,
Frank Ongaro,"Third, during the public comment period over 58,000 comments were received through three well publicized and well attended public meetings and various other public comment opportunities. The DNR, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U. S.

Steven Ring,I find that the Final EIS has several deficiencies that indicate that the design of this mine and mill will not satisfactorily protect Minnesota’s environment.,PD,NS,X,1,
Steven Ring,"Direction of flow of ground--water: there is no evaluation of the impact on the environment from possible large ground-- water flows in a northerly direction from one of the pits. We are just provided with “we will monitor and adapt”. We, the public, have been monitoring and adapting on the Dunka Pit’s drainage for many years without solving the issue. The implications of the GLIFWC modeling suggest there could be millions of gallons per day flowing north. Where is the description of potential impacts? Where is the clear description of the technology and actions that will be taken? nan",WAT,S,N,8,"MDNR et al. 2015c; DNR disagrees with GLIFWC’s application of the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model because that agency modified the model outside its intended purpose as defined in Final SDD Section 6.2. The Final SDD required the groundwater flow model to predict pit inflows at various stages of pit development (i.e., year 1, year 5, year 10, year 20) and include operation, closure, and post-closure. The model satisfies this condition of the final scoping decision. GLIFWC changed the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model to include future mining activity at the NorthShore Mine Peter Mitchell Pits, which is outside the scope of the EIS. If the EIS scope were defined to assess of how future activity at the Peter Mitchell Pit might influence the closure conditions at the NorthMet site, then additional data would be required north of the Mine Site on which to refine the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model for : 1) vertical hydraulic conductivity for wetlands and surficial deposits; 2) horizontal hydraulic conductivities in bedrock (e.g., Virginia Formation; BIF); 3) variability of hydraulic conductivities within the bedrock units, and 4) the hydrologic significance of 100 Mile Swamp in providing a source of water for downward leakage. Each of these refinements is important to quantitatively assess the likelihood and potential magnitude of a northward bedrock flowpath. Modeling would also have to reconcile uncertainty regarding the sequence and timing of future Northshore mining operations, including the depth"
Steven Ring,Mine pit water must be treated forever: It is truly incredible that an EIS for a proposed mine could be considered “adequate” with a design that will require treating water for an unknown amount of time (> 100 years). It is time to acknowledge that the technology to mine these minerals safely is not represented by the NorthMet project plan.,PD,NS,X,1,
Steven Ring,"Financial assurances: I realize that financial assurances are not necessarily part of the FEIS, but they actually are directly pertinent to the capability of the proposed mine to meet environmental requirements. If a ridiculously expensive design were proposed to meet water quality standards for a mine, the permitting agencies would realize it and reject the design as impractical. Yet, those agencies seem to be willing to consider a design and plan that is similarly ridiculous. The unknown, but lifetimes long requirement for treatment is fraught with exceptional financial risk. Financial risk leads to environmental risk due to inability to continue treating the water or maintain the facility. Recent history has several examples of mining companies declaring bankruptcy and leaving taxpayer to pick up the costs. What are the chances of this happening in a 500-- year treatment project? Please recognize that this plan is unworkable and this FEIS is inadequate and unacceptable.",FIN,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme FIN 06
Steven Ring,"4) Cumulative effects: I know that you are constrained to evaluate cumulative impacts based only on projects that are well developed. However, this project is taking place in a region with many similar mineral deposits and a high likelihood that some will be developed. Sulfide ore mining is inherently much more risky to the environment than hematite or taconite mining. As such, design failure can have a much larger impact. Therefore, the design of the mine, processing facility and tailings basin should be required to meet a much higher standard than iron oxide mining. In addition, if the risk of failure at one sulfide mine is X, the risk of failure at five mines would be 5X. Because of the catastrophic nature of possible sulfide mining failures, the design requirements for sulfide mining must be extremely high. This, first mine in the region, must meet those extremely high requirements. Unfortunately, I see no discussion of these requirements in the FEIS, and lots of discussion in the press of potential design weaknesses.",PD,NS,X,1,
Steven Ring,"Conclusion: There are many innovative approaches in the proposed design for the NorthMet project. Clearly, they have attempted to come up with a plan to mine sulfide minerals in a water--rich region of the earth that would extract the minerals and preserve the environment. However, it has become clear that they have not succeeded. The ore is so lean that massive amounts must be mined exposing large pits and lots of rock with sulfide metal exposures. The need to treat water for centuries is a significant design failure; it is likely to be impossible. The complexities of the flow of water off the site must be addressed. It is another design failure. Protecting the environment while sulfide mining in an area with large amounts of water is known to be extremely difficult – maybe, it has never been done. Several studies of how well mining operation met their water quality prediction have been completed. The results are daunting. Here is a comment on that from the Minesite Drainage Assessment Group (MDAG). (They are also quoted on a different topic in section 5.2.2 of the SDEIS): “Maest et al. (2006a and 2006b) and Kuipers et al. (2006) compiled comparisons of (a) predicted drainage chemistries before mining to (b) measured drainage chemistries after mining started. They found: -- Three--quarters (75%) of mining case studies with close proximities to waters underestimated (underpredicted) drainage chemistry and thus the downstream environmental effects. This was often due to overestimation of the effectiveness of mitigation measures. “ This is a company that has never run a mine, and thus there is no history with which to judge its capabilities. The agencies are exhibiting extreme credulity to expect that the plan for this project will meet its goals and protect Minnesota’s environment. No design or plan for something this complex is perfect, but the idea that we can “adapt” or “improvise” when some very predictable problems occur that were not considered in the FEIS is unacceptable. These situations are likely to compromise water quality or other resources. Please consider that the design of this project is flawed. We are not producing widgets in a manufacturing plant. This mine will operate in the natural environment with water, sun, snow, ice and storms. It is incredibly risky to accept this EIS as being adequate to actually protect those resources. As it stands, the FEIS leaves far too many unanswered questions, and evaluates far too few “what if” scenarios that have a probability of arising. Those minerals should be left in the ground until a company with a proven track record and a proven design and plan can extract them safely.",GEN,NS,X,1,
Susan Lynn,"I writing to call attention to your primary responsibility as elected leaders that you hold in trust the common property shared by the people of Minnesota. It is your duty to use scientific information to disallow pollution, resource destruction, chemical introduction and other harm to our resources. You cannot allow risk to be taken unless and until conclusive proof exists that such practices will not pose harm. Sulfide mining carries tremendous risk to the water and to the people of our state and the continent. The risk is well documented. Those who are in control of the corporations you are speaking with today are such people as Tony Hayward upon who’s watch the gulf was harmed profoundly by Deep Water Horizon. You are allowing corporations like Antofogasta and Glencore with histories of grave pollution and abuse, of workers, to set up camp in Minnesota to the detriment of the people. While this will put money in the pockets of lawyers and a small host of other people, the people this will take money from will have scant share in the profits and would not want it at the real cost it comes at. We citizens quite literally allow you to take food from people’s mouths by permitting mining companies to leak, ooze, pour or gush sulfide and other chemicals into the water. Sulfide interacts with mercury to produce methylmercury, the kind that lingers in the body, literally indefinitely, and harms babies in their mother’s womb. Mercury is a byproduct of mining. Mercury harms neurological development. Presently 1 in 10 babies born on the North Shore of Lake Superior have abnormally high levels of mercury in their bodies at birth. The St Louis River has such high levels of mercury at present that no plan can be formulated to remove it, and make the fish safe to eat. The levels of mercury in the fish are such that those in our state who seek to sustain their lives eating the fish cannot do so. Half a billion dollars have been spent of the people’s tax money to clean the waste that mining has heftily contributed to in the St Louis River, and still it remains polluted beyond health. It is further endangered now by plans for sulfide mining in the Duluth Complex which stretches from north of Ely to south of Aitkin. We have treaties with tribes that we must honor, that grant them the right to hunt and to fish. If we render the fish inedible we dishonor and eviscerate that treaty. We would like to protect fishing, wild rice harvesting and farming for all citizens of Minnesota and surrounding areas of the Midwest. I ask you to honor the responsibility you have to the people now and in the future. We are being put at risk by decisions to allow risk to our water from Sulfide Mining in the Northeast of Minnesota. Lake Superior holds 1/10th of the nation’s fresh surface water and every person on the continent has a right to that water. It is not something the people can allow you, as the trustees of our lands and water and air, to permit it to be destroyed.

C.A.Arneson,"The PolyMet SDEIS does not [adequately] address loss of habitat and other impacts to Minnesota’s moose population by proposed sulfide mining, as well as by taconite mining. This needs to be researched. Coal mining had its canary; it could be taconite mining (and other industry) has Minnesota’s moose. Minnesota needs to have the results of an extensive moose study before it looks at sulfide mining projects; it needs to rule out any possible connections. Having suggested two reasonable possibilities that may be related to the moose losses in Minnesota, I contacted several individuals connected with the moose study and to my knowledge most have been dubious. So I am including my article, and further information I have gathered, as part of my comments, asking that it be considered seriously. I made the possible connections to sulfates and methyl mercury because I was researching the mining issue, including sulfates; if some good can come of it for Minnesota’s moose it would be worth the years of my life I have spent trying to protect Minnesota’s waters. If there were any merit to my theory I hope it would not be dismissed due to political and corporate pressures, or simply because it came from someone outside the ‘ranks.’ Minnesota’s moose are an icon of our State; I care as much as anyone.

The theory discussed is brilliant and highly plausible; particularly the link to warming climate."" I found a paper online this past summer that I had not seen when I was researching for my article; it may be that someone posted it after I wrote the article. The paper is, ""Transformation of mercuric chloride and methylmercury by the rumen microflora."" http://aem.asm.org/content/38/4/626.long Evidently in the 1970's there was also concern about mercury exposure to rumen microflora. The study I linked above was done in 1979 and the results seemed to indicate that there was an equilibrium established between demethylation and methylation in the rumen that protected ruminants. Not long after I found the 1979 study, I came across a paper that reported (recently) identifying the bacterial families in a moose rumen and colon (the author, from the University of Vermont, has since been in touch and I have attached her info below).** I had been thinking that the 1979 paper had only looked at a few bacteria that the researchers felt were responsible for demethylation (and not in moose). I wondered just how many of the bacteria were responsible for mercury methylation and how many for demethylation (and how much effect each had), and if there was some way that the numbers would make a difference (could perhaps change the equilibrium). Also, the bacteria present in the rumen would be related to what a moose ate. I later learned that the Vermont researcher had seen my article and decided to take a look at demethylation in relationship to the bacteria she had identified — we were probably reading what the other wrote about the same time. Just a few months ago, I came across a paper that several college students had written; I subsequently spoke to their professor and expressed an interest in what his students had written concerning demethylation and rising temperatures. (In my article I had linked rising temperatures to the possibility of methylmercury being produced in the moose rumen — increased activity by anaerobic bacteria as temperatures increased.) The professor then told me about a paper he felt would be most helpful to me, one that his students had used for reference.* (At the time I did not discuss my theory with him, just asked about demethylation.) Basically, there is evidence emerging that indicates mercury methylation increases as temperatures rise and demethylation decreases as temperatures rise, possibly creating greater net mercury methylation. Higher temperatures and higher methylation occur in the summer months. (Also a time when more unexplained moose deaths are occurring in Minnesota.) So, my thought is this: with warming temperatures the equilibrium in a moose rumen between demethylation and methylation may no longer be balanced (or offset) as moose become increasingly overheated. Moose may no longer be protected, if indeed they were. Species with larger body mass would be most significantly affected by climate change because of difficulty with thermoregulation. The Minnesota Zoo, in an article about their work with moose, stated: ""Another concern is thermoregulation. (Adult moose have low surface-area-to-volume ratio, placing constraints on their heat dissipation capacities.)"" Difficulty with thermoregulation could affect any equilibrium between demethylation and methylation in the rumen. Methylmercury could in turn interfere with thermoregulation. If the effects (resulting in death of an animal) were relatively sudden, how would that affect detection during a necropsy? *The paper below is the one that I was told I would find helpful (Vermont students used it for their research). It is often cited and well respected. I copied the pertinent section on temperature:",WI,S,N,8,SDEIS Theme WI 02
C.A.Arneson,"Mercury in the Aquatic Environment: A Review of Factors Affecting Methylation Susanne M. Ullrich, Trevor W. Tanton, and Svetlana A. Abdrashitovab Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Southampton, U.K.; Institute of Microbiology and Virology, Almaty, Kazakhstan 2. Temperature “It has been observed frequently that Hg methylation rates in aquatic systems peak during the summer months (Jackson et al.; Callister and Winfrey; Korthals and Winfrey; Bubb et al.; Hintelmann and Wilken; Watras et al.). Most studies have shown maximum methylation activity occurs during mid or late summer, although Bloom et al. found a sharp peak in sediment MMHg production in early spring, followed by a slow decrease throughout the remainder of the year. Seasonal variations in MMHg production and decomposition generally have been attributed to temperature effects, but are probably also linked with seasonal changes in productivity/nutrient supply and redox conditions (cf. Section III.B.5). Temperature most likely affects methylation as a result of its effect on the overall microbial activity (Bisogni and Lawrence). Wright and Hamilton noted that MMHg release from sediments at 4 degrees C was only 50 to 70% of that observed at 20 degrees C, suggesting that net MMHg production may be significantly decreased in winter due to lower rates of growth and metabolic activity, and Callister and Winfrey reported microbial Hg methylation in surficial river sediments had a temperature optimum of 35 degrees C. Korthals and Winfrey found that while both temperature and anoxic conditions were important factors influencing net methylation, temperature alone accounted for about 30% of the variation. The data suggested that increased net MMHg production was partly due to decreased demethylation rather than an increase in the actual methylation rate, however. Several other workers have also found that demethylation is favored by low temperatures, whereas higher temperatures favor methylation, leading to a large increase in net MMHg production in the summer (Bodaly et al.; Ramlal et al.). Abiotic methylation by humic substances has also been shown to gain in importance with increasing temperature (cf. Section III.A.2), but it is probably of little/ minor significance compared with biotic methylation. In contrast to the findings of Ramlal et al. and Bodaly et al., Matilainen et al. found that the highest rates of both methylation and demethylation in surficial lake sediments coincided with maximum temperatures. Similarly, Matilainen and Verta found microbial demethylation rates in aerobic surface waters of small forest lakes (up to 13.2% d-1) were decreased by low temperatures. Temperature is clearly an important factor controlling both methylation and demethylation. It appears that moderately high temperatures have a stimulating effect on Hg methylation, which is most likely due to increased microbial activity. Together with seasonal changes in oxygen levels and organic content/primary production, this seems to account for the increased MMHg production rates usually observed in the summer. The results for Hg demethylation are somewhat contradictory, but most workers found demethylation is favored by lower temperatures. It may be that the rate of methylation increases faster than the rate of demethylation with increasing temperature.” **This is the message I received from the Vermont researcher (Suzanne Ishaq): “Sorry it took me so long to get back to you, I had to dig through some data to find what I was looking for. I have done more sequencing on moose rumen bacteria using the Vermont samples, as well as some Alaskan and Norwegian. I didn't find very many bacteria in any of the three populations which were capable of demethylating mercury or reducing sulfate, so I ended up not focusing on that in that manuscript [manuscript in review]. Alaska did have more than the other two, and they were fresh off a summer diet whereas the other two locations were on a fall diet, but it still wasn't very many. I also couldn't distinguish which species they were, just that they were of the genus Pseudomonas, so they weren't necessarily capable of demethylation. And I didn't have enough Alaskan samples to know if it was just those moose which happened to have slightly higher counts than moose in other locations, or whether all moose in Alaska have elevated numbers of demethylating bacteria. Bacteria which can demethylate mercury include (but aren't limited to) some species of Pseudomonas sp., and Micrococcus sp. (Kozak S, Forsberg CW: Transformation of mercuric chloride and methylmercury by the rumen microflora. Appl Env. Microbiol 1979, 38:626?636.) and some bacteria in the genera Desulfomicrobium, Desulfovibrio, Desulfatibacillum, and Desulfobulbus (Bridou R, Monperrus M, Gonzalez PR, Guyoneaud R, Amouroux D: Simultaneous determination of mercury methylation and demethylation capacities of various sulfate-reducing bacteria using species-specific isotopic tracers. Env. Toxicol Chem 2011, 30:337?44). Your theory does sound like a good one; unfortunately I don't think anyone is working on the rumen populations with demethylation in mind. You would need to try and track moose so you knew where they were feeding, and at least sequence the plant matter in the rumen as well so you could tie the bacteria in with diet (i.e. aquatic plant species so you could tell if they were actually eating from swamps). You would also need to look into summer versus winter diets, to make sure that the bacterial levels were actually changing in response to the seasonal change of mercury. The problem with studying moose is that it is difficult to get fresh rumen samples without hunting the moose; you might have some luck looking into reindeer or wild deer species, since they are often studied in higher numbers, and then extrapolating. I know that Alaskan moose and reindeer have lower mercury levels than other wild ruminants, including those in Norway (6.

Lokken JA, Finstad GL, Dunlap KL, Duffy LK: Baseline environmental biomonitoring of mercury for risk assessment and reindeer management on the Seward Peninsula, St. Lawrence Island, and Fairbanks, AK. 2008.), so maybe it is because they have higher levels of demethylating mercury.",WI,S,N,8,SDEIS Theme WI 02

There are high geological sulfate concentrations, atmospheric sulfate and mercury deposition, but most importantly frequent flooding that exacerbates the spread of sulfates, the release of sequestered mercury, and the microbial production of methyl mercury; especially within the numerous impoundments that have been built to control the flooding (attractive and easy feeding locations for moose). Research has shown that these impoundments have elevated methyl mercury levels; higher than those found in natural surface waters. http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70024482 Simply put, impoundments are sulfate/mercury/methylmercury sinks. As well as prime feeding locations for moose. There are also agricultural and industrial sources. Among them, commercial wild rice fields (studies in California http://ca.water.usgs.gov/mercury/yoloBypass.html http://swrcb2.swrcb.ca.gov/centralvalley/water_issues/tmdl/central_valley_projec ts/delta_hg/other_technical_reports/ybwa_hg_final_rpt.pdf have found mercury and methylmercury in wild rice); coal-fired electrical plants, ash ponds and landfills; fertilizers and fungicides; use of copper sulfate; beet farming, beet processing and its waste; drainage ditches; reservoirs; water treatment plants; Boise Cascade's paper mill at International Falls, reportedly between 1990 and 1994 Boise was among the top three facilities reporting the most toxic pollution of Minnesota's waters. (What effect did ash wastes from its boilers have when spread on local farm fields?) I would also suggest that the moose study results reported in May 2013, showing Voyageurs National Park moose on the Kabetogama peninsula holding their own, may be quite significant since they would be the group most isolated from a sulfate/methylmercury connection in Minnesota.",WI,S,N,8,SDEIS Theme WI 02
C.A.Arneson,"Further information: Gypsum (calcium sulfate) I recently came across a peer-reviewed paper on sulfur: “The Relationship Between Sulfur, Thiamine, and Polioencephalomalacia – A Review.” It stated: “Sulfur was first linked to PEM in the 1980's when investigators determined that gypsum (calcium sulfate) added to cattle rations to control feed intake caused PEM. When gypsum was removed from rations, the incidence of PEM decreased.” The word gypsum struck a cord, because limestone would be used in sulfide mining processing, creating massive amounts of (synthetic) gypsum as the byproduct; gypsum would also be produced from the coal-fired electricity powering the proposed mines. (Limestone is currently used for remediation at taconite sites). [Also used as a flux in processing taconite.] I knew there already were very high sulfate levels in areas surrounding taconite mines and other anthropogenic sources (power plants, water treatment plants). However, depending on how elevated the sulfate levels are, water can be bitter tasting; if given a choice ruminants would generally choose other waters. I also knew that extensive amounts of limestone are used for treating mining waste (as well as in coal fired power plants), which would not only mix with the sulfates but I suspected would also make a difference in the taste. I was curious. So I purchased some calcium sulfate from an animal nutritionist (he has been in the business for many years; feed supplier; works with veterinarians). I discovered calcium sulfate is quite tasteless. He tried it too. I told him why I was curious about it, and he brought up another point. If moose are anything like cattle, they know enough to lick soil/calcium carbonate/gypsum, something neutralizing – like us taking Tums – when their rumens are upset (can help regulate pH so the rumen does not get too acidic) or if they are lacking calcium. So limestone or gypsum (calcium sulfate) may be very attractive to moose; if they get too much sulfate along with it however, it would also be a very big problem. Evidently, according to the DNR, PEM had not been diagnosed during the necropsies of moose that died. However, I suggest not ruling it out as a possibility, particularly when looking at proposed sulfide mining. “The most dramatic manifestations of S toxicity in ruminants are sudden death, with no lesions, and/or PEM. Polioencephalomalacia is a neurological disease of cattle and sheep, resulting in seizures, ataxia, blindness, and recumbency as the main clinical signs. It is usually fatal. Seven hundred of 2,200 ewes grazing a pasture previously sprayed with elemental S began showing signs of abdominal discomfort within two hours of exposure, and 220 ewes died within five days. Lesions of PEM were found only in the sheep that had survived for five days.” (Water Quality for Wyoming Livestock & Wildlife) https://deq.state.wy.us/wqd/wqd_home/announcements/final draft_1.pdf Perhaps there are moose fatalities that are acute cases, without time for lesions to appear. It is possible for moose to develop PEM; there was a suspected case in North Dakota (grain overload) that was written about by DNR veterinarian Erika Butler. Which brings up the point that moose have moved into North Dakota, reinforcing the appearance that there is more at play than global warming. There have also been suspected cases of PEM in deer. What were the “ten percent of brain lesions of unidentifiable origins” found in 634 moose killed by hunters in Minnesota between 2007 and 2013?

C.A.Arneson,"Questions: What are the mercury levels in Minnesota’s moose (blood and cord blood, hair, tissue, muscle, organs, teeth)? Saying that they are “not seeing anything to be concerned about” is too vague. How much is too much? Where are moose feeding? What are they eating? Have the aquatic and terrestrial plants and browse that moose eat been tested for sulfates, mercury, methylmercury (what about cadmium, other metals)? http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101105085330.htm http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Maine-Moose- Hunters-Warned-Of- Possible-Cadmium-Contamination/id-7b70be903d1fbbfe79cbcaa3e6d15a8a Has anyone done the following to investigate methylmercury and the rumen? Suggestion from a scientist now working in the medical field: “I do not know much about the moose rumen but I assume it’s pretty similar to other ruminants. I actually found an article (attached here) that might point in a direction for necropsy tissue choices. The reason I found it is that I searched for the parameters that I recall being used decades ago in assessing domestic ruminant's health, which focused on papillary health. That's generally a good area to focus on in any animal's alimentary canal. This moose article used a similar approach. Two thoughts: perhaps one could assay this papillary tissue assay, based on the gross anatomical parameters as defined in the attached article, and couple that with an enzymatic transferase assay such as that noted in [the following link] http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etc.5620210610/abstract;jsessionid= 38D9E970813AF7D03FB08B00A3F4303E.d03t03?deniedAccessCustomisedMessag e=&userIsAuthenticated=false. While I realize the latter is done in soil, recall that much of the soil enzymatic environment reflects anaerobic acidic activity due to the volatile fatty acids produced by those bugs. So I think either that soil assay, or something analogous, could work well with the rumen necropsy material. If you have the capability, I would seriously try to recover the VFA rumen fluid and analyze it by liquid chromatography if you have that type of asset available to you. It's a tricky recovery if your material is remote in the field as the VFA chemistry changes quickly upon exposure to air when removed from the animal. It is best captured by aspirating with a gas tight syringe, which can then be placed directly into dry ice level chilling storage for transport.” Precisely, where are moose in Minnesota dying and are there any location relationships to high sulfate and mercury sources/levels nearby? Is there a map with the moose fatalities pinpointed for the public to see the locations? Minnesota’s moose are important! They may also be trying to tell us something. We need to understand what it is, not permit sulfide mining when we do not know what the ramifications may be to our rapidly declining moose population. I would like to add for my Final EIS comment the following: Minnesota has seen a high incidence of moose calf deaths and a surprising willingness for moose cows to abandon their young. Blame has been placed on wolves by many, but is it not possible that the effects of sulfates and/or mercury could be responsible for the calf loss and for the erratic behavior by cows? Perhaps causing an inherent weakness in newborn calves? Perhaps the effects of mercury are not enough to kill directly, but are enough to change the behavior of the mothers and the resistance/strength of their calves, making them easy prey for predators?",WI,S,N,8,SDEIS Theme WI 02

Water quality data collected from two deep boreholes in the area where the Project mine pit(s) will be located found tritium and un- ionized ammonia nitrogen. Both tritium and un-ionized ammonia indicate a strong connection with surface water. Tritium indicates that the water found in the deep boreholes was on the surface sometime after 1950, during or after nuclear testing when atmospheric deposition of this pollutant occurred. Un-ionized ammonia is produced by ore blasting activities. The bore holes where this pollution was measured are approximately one mile southwest of the Peter Mitchell Pit, which is the closest potential source of this pollution and has violated its NPDES permit on several occasions for exceeding un-ionized ammonia limits. Therefore, this data indicates that the PolyMet mine site is already hydrologically connected to the Peter Mitchell Pit through fractures. The distance between the Peter Mitchell Pit and the Project proposed pit(s) is approximately one mile, indicating that groundwater travel time through bedrock fractures will be orders of magnitude faster than Project modeling suggests. Such a connection means that dewatering of the mine pits will cause significant drawdown of the water table in the surficial aquifer, potentially dewatering wetlands and ephemeral streams.

Margaret Watkins,"Anthony Runkel, Chief Geologist with the Minnesota Geological Survey, himself contradicted this approach in his comments on the NorthMet SDEIS:85 Investigations aimed at characterizing the hydrogeologic conditions of fractured bedrock for the purposes of predicting solute transport in crystalline bedrock elsewhere on the Canadian Shield routinely use a number of well-known techniques that were not applied in the hydrogeologic studies at the NorthMet Mine Site and Plant Site/Tailings Basin area. A key component of those investigations is the acquisition of hydraulic and water chemistry data at relatively discrete intervals of bedrock, with the focus on fracture characterization. In part this is accomplished through testing and water sampling of boreholes constructed with relatively short open hole intervals at variable depths (e.g. “nested” wells) and/or discrete interval packer testing and water sampling of long open holes. When these techniques have been used in generally similar hydrogeologic settings elsewhere on the Canadian Shield, the results support hydrogeologic conceptual models that differ substantially from those proposed for the Duluth Complex and Giants Range Batholith described in the SDEIS. Of particular significance for solute transport, the conceptual models commonly include key fractures or fracture zones of relatively high hydraulic conductivity, and multiple flow systems within the bedrock at individual sites. These flow systems are variably connected to the surface water system, have variable residence times, can have upward and downward vertical gradients within a local area, and horizontal flow directions that differ from one another. The data collected thus far from the proposed NorthMet Mine Site and Plant Site/Tailings Basin area are not sufficient to recognize the kinds of hydrogeologic features known to be characteristic of other crystalline bedrock settings on the Canadian Shield, described above. Nor are the data sufficient to adequately support the simpler conceptual model currently depicted in the SDEIS.

Although the SDEIS and FEIS were revised to reflect the Project proponents’ preferred action, still, the only alternative analyzed in any detail concerns the acreage of the proposed land exchange. This does not represent rigorous exploration and objective evaluation of potential alternatives and is a serious violation of NEPA that has not been remedied. Exacerbating the problems that have persisted throughout the DEIS and SDEIS, the adaptive management concepts listed below (grout curtain, pit lake depression, groundwater extraction wells, artificial recharge) represent new MDOs regarding potential alternatives that were not even disclosed in the FEIS. In sum, the FEIS, SDEIS, and DEIS have all failed to substantively consider many alternatives that may provide mitigation for, or prevent long-term environmental damage. If the mitigations that have been listed above had been given the “hard look,” as least some of them would have been considered Project alternatives. However, as plainly stated in chapter 3, “[u]ltimately, the NorthMet Project No Action Alternative was the only alternative evaluated in detail in this FEIS.” Instead, “adaptive management concepts” appear to have replaced the alternative analysis—but these do not comply with NEPA or replace a true alternatives analysis. Many of the adaptive management concepts should have been rigorously explored and objectively evaluated to determine the cost and associated potential environmental benefits. These concepts appear in the FEIS text as “strategies” or “plans.” In chapter 5, adaptive management is defined as “a system of management practices, based on clearly defined outcomes and monitoring requirements, that assesses whether management actions are meeting the desired outcomes, and, if not, prescribes potential actions that would ensure the defined outcomes are met.” But even in the adaptive management plans provided the potential actions that “would ensure the defined outcomes are met” haven’t been rigorously evaluated to determine if they could actually be implemented, and if so, whether the desired results would be attained. There are no “trigger points” for implementation; instead the FEIS states that “periodic assessments would be carried out to ensure continuous protection of groundwater and surface water quality and compliance with water quality-based effluent limits.”180 This is troubling because periodic assessments (if measurements are required) are indications of water quality. Modeling may be used if an up-tick in concentrations is identified prior to an exceedance of water quality standards. However, without trigger points in the adaptive water management plan (“AWMP”), “periodic” seems to indicate that opportunities to apply adaptive water management to prevent pollution will only mitigate pollution once it has occurred.",ALT,S,O,5,"SDEIS Themes ALT 04, ALT 13, ALT 21, ALT 24, WR 007, WR 130"
Margaret Watkins,"The MNDNR and USACE considered underground mining as an alternative to the proposed open pit(s) for the DEIS in 2009, but eliminated it because it would have had “a significantly reduced rate of operation that would not be considered economically feasible, and, therefore, would not meet the Purpose and Need of the Project.”183 Even though underground mining was reconsidered for the SDEIS, the Co-Lead Agencies did not “exercise a degree of skepticism in dealing with self- serving statements from the prime beneficiary of a project”184 when analyzing this (or any other) alternative. The Project proponent eliminated the alternative based solely on an economic decision that underground mining would not be as profitable as open pit mining. The Co-Leads stated in the SDEIS that “it was not possible to undertake a quantitative, side-by- side assessment of the underground mining alternative.”185 Thereafter, the FEIS concludes an underground mine would have a reduced mining rate and life of mine, employed fewer workers for a shorter period of time, and reduced state and local tax revenues.186 Conversely, although the underground mining alternative would offer environmental benefits, the SDEIS included no economic analysis of those benefits. Still, the Co-Lead Agencies determined that underground mining would result in reduced socioeconomic benefits, and “PolyMet would not move forward with an unprofitable project, thus any potential environmental or socioeconomic benefits associated with this alternative are moot.”187 Although underground mining was considered technically feasible, the Co-Leads further provided that: PolyMet is a private sector and for-profit company, the value of the saleable material would need to provide sufficient income to cover operating cost (which includes, but is not limited to, the cost of mining, processing, transportation, and waste management), capital cost (to build and sustain facilities), an adequate return to investors, reclamation, and closure costs and taxes. Using underground mining would result in most of the NorthMet Deposit left unmined because of its low metal value (i.e., less value than the cost of mining and mineral processing). Other material would have to be left in place for safety reasons, to prevent collapse.188 Therefore: ...the Co-lead Agencies found that while underground mining is technically feasible, available, and would offer significant environmental benefits over the proposed NorthMet Project, it would not be economically feasible and would not meet the Purpose and Need. Since the underground mining alternative would not meet all of the screening criteria, it is not considered to be a reasonable alternative. Therefore, the underground mining alternative was eliminated from further evaluation in the SDEIS.189 An additional purpose for re-assessing the underground mining alternative became known during consultation with the Bands under Section106 of the National Historic Preservation Act: avoidance of adverse impacts to a traditional cultural property, the Lake Vermillion Beaver Bay Trail (“BBLVT”), which transects a portion of the proposed east pit. Even though avoidance is supposed to be the first consideration before mitigation can be considered for cultural resources, this benefit, along with numerous environmental benefits that an underground mine would afford, were not given adequate consideration and the underground mining alternative remains eliminated from consideration in the FEIS. In no way does this constitute an appropriate level of detail. The conclusion that underground mining is not viable, or preferable, remains substantially unjustified, despite repeated requests for further analysis.190 It is not even a sufficient cost-benefit analysis. The CEQ regulations require that, only where a cost-benefit analysis is “relevant to the choice among environmentally different alternatives,” there are a variety of additional requirements, including “analysis of un-quantified environmental impacts, values, and amenities,”191 in addition to other CEQ alternatives rules. Here, the FEIS does not consider the economic impact of perpetual treatment, and the economic analysis provided by the Project proponent summarily concludes that underground mining is “[n]ot economically viable”—while contradictorily claiming that backfilling the west pit would create encumbrances not allowed in their lease due to minerals located below the west pit that can only be accessed through underground mining. This is not the appropriate use of a cost-benefit analysis for purposes of analyzing an EIS alternative. As the Band already argued in the Tribal Position, significant additional study of the underground mining alternative is mandated, and the SDEIS and the FEIS offer no new discussion of the reasons for rejecting the alternative. An appropriate analysis of the economic viability of an underground mine depends on a variety of factors including ore grade, market prices, cost of tailings, and waste rock disposal. In fact, a study of this particular deposit was performed by the prior owner of the site, U.S. Steel, which actually recommended underground mining.193 PolyMet is well aware of this study, given that the company included it in a 2003 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.194 In fact, by examining cross-sections showing the distribution of ore by depth,195 it appears that there are substantial ore reserves at depths that likely could not be accessed by the proposed open-pit mine. The ecological costs of open-pit mining and above-ground disposal of tailings and waste rock are immense— and there are clearly economic considerations that would cut in favor of underground mining. This ecological cost, combined with the most current understanding of deposit ore grades and reasonably possible metals prices, and the costs associated with perpetual treatment and adaptive management concepts should have been evaluated to determine the viability of this alternative.",ALT,S,O,10,"SDEIS Themes ALT 01, ALT 16"
Margaret Watkins,"Grout curtains (grout injected into fractures via a series of closely spaced drilled holes) are a fairly common mitigation strategy that can be effective if installed around the entire perimeter of the pit prior to mining. However, due to expense, PolyMet is only planning to try to grout individual faults or fractures once a water quality or quantity problem has occurred. This adaptive management concept has no trigger point associated with it to make clear when and if it would be employed: “At the NorthMet Mine Site, if monitoring and analysis indicate conditions could arise that create a northward flowpath, PolyMet would have the necessary information about site conditions to grout fractures and faults.”196 Even PolyMet has admitted this is not likely to be successful stating “its effectiveness at the NorthMet site is uncertain.”197",WAT,S,O,10,SDEIS Theme WR 007.

Margaret Watkins,"One of the AMCs is pit lake depression, which would prevent a northward flow of groundwater if the water levels in the PolyMet pits were kept at an elevation below the Northshore Peter Mitchell Pit. However, flooding the pits is a critical component of the proposed action because in order to comply with MN WQS the most reactive waste rock and pit walls must be covered as quickly as possible. Yet this is not part of the AMC. Even PolyMet admits that, without pit flooding, a higher capacity wastewater treatment facility and additional treatment processes may be needed and additional expenses would be incurred. At closure, discharges to the Partridge River would need to be increased and construction of a wetland in the east pit would not be possible. This is an inadequately developed AMC that would have cascading adverse environmental impacts and demonstrates the lack of “rigor in exploration and objectivity in evaluation” when it was proposed.

Margaret Watkins,"Another AMC is groundwater extraction wells, which have the potential to reduce or prevent a northward flow of contaminants. But similar to the two previous AMCs, there is no trigger point associated with it to make clear when and if it would be employed. It also suffers from the same lack of exploratory rigor and evaluation objectivity. The number, location, and capacities of the wells are unknown, along with the associated number of acres of ground disturbance because access roads to the wells would be required in addition to electrical and water lines for pumped water. Further, wetlands would be directly impacted, but the acreage and wetland types are not known. Nevertheless, without support, the FEIS assures the reader that “[i]f the number of wells necessary resulted in unacceptable wetland impacts, other mitigation measures used in tandem with extraction wells would lower the number of required extraction wells.”",WAT,S,N,12,Consideration of potential northward groundwater flow at the mine site and proposed contingency measures are address in FEIS Section 5.2.2.3.5 and FEIS Reference MDNR et al 2015c.
Margaret Watkins,"Artificial recharge using an infiltration trench or wells simply will not work at this site because it is too flat—but it still appears as an AMC. But clearly this concept hasn’t been rigorously explored or objectively evaluated. The elevation of the bottom of the surficial deposits shown in an October 12, 2015 Co-Lead memo204 is 1,625 to 1,650 feet above sea level; however, the land surface or top of the surficial deposits is only at an elevation of 1,600 feet above land surface based on MNDNR topographical maps using LiDAR technology.205 In other words, in the Co-Lead memo, the land surface is depicted as floating 25 to 50 feet in the air! The science fiction of floating surficial deposits is not simply a graphical error; it is in fact the only way a groundwater mound could be “created” at this site because of its topography.208 In addition, the size of the groundwater mound, the source of water, the number of wells or the size of a trench; the acreage of land disturbance created by roads, wells, or a trench, water supply and electrical lines; or the acreage of wetland disturbance, are all unknown.209 Mining need not be synonymous with pollution: “In the right place – and with conscientious companies, new technologies and good planning –many of the potential impacts are avoidable. In fact, most mine pollution arises from negligence, not necessity.”210 But the NEPA “hard look” requires agencies to “exercise a degree of skepticism in dealing with self-serving statements from the prime beneficiary of a project”211 when analyzing alternatives. Defects in the AMC and alternatives analysis here are stark enough to suggest lack of rigor on by the Project proponent at best, and data manipulation at the worst.

Margaret Watkins,"Moreover, the proposed Project is located entirely within the boundaries of the 1854 Ceded Territory. Yet despite specific and repeated requests from tribal cooperating agencies, the Co-Leads did not elect to utilize a tool developed in 2011 by the EPA in cooperation with tribes, Applying Cumulative Impact Analysis Tools to Tribes and Tribal Lands, in order to discern potential cumulative effects to resources important to the tribes who retain usufructuary rights within the 1854 Ceded Territory. And the Co-Leads rejected the Tribal Cooperating Agencies’ repeated requests to evaluate the 1854 Ceded Territory (discussed further below) as the CEAA. To the contrary, the FEIS states that: At various times during consultation for the NorthMet Project Proposed Action, the Bands have proposed using an expanded area for analysis of cumulative effects on cultural resources and natural resources of significance to the Bands, including use of the 1854 Ceded Territory as the CEAA. The Co-lead Agencies believe that the use of the 1854 Ceded Territory as the CEAA for cultural resources would actually diminish the significance of any cumulative effect. This conclusion flies in the face of the data. In September 2013, the Tribal Cooperating Agencies collaborated to produce a 60-page Cumulative Effects Analysis, which appears at Attachment 3 to Appendix C to the SDEIS, along with other tribal comments. Both the SDEIS and FEIS failed to take into account most of the issues cited therein. So, in addition to reasserting and incorporating again all those comments, the Band hired the University of Minnesota Duluth (“UMD”) and the Natural Resources Research Institute (“NRRI”) to analyze 1854 Ceded Territory cumulative impacts to wetlands, historic trails connectivity, public access to exercise usufructuary rights, and wildlife passage. In all four areas of analysis, the cumulative effects to the 1854 Ceded Territory resulting from mining on the Iron Range are most distinctive and welldefined. The historic trails connectivity analysis demonstrates that although there have been impacts over time most of the trail corridors are still largely intact and connected to each other throughout the 1854 Ceded Territory. The trail analysis also identified areas that are the most critical to maintain network-wide connections.",CR,S,O,5,SDEIS Themes CR 08
Margaret Watkins,"Wildlife passage from south to north is critical to ensure that as the climate warms species can move north in order to survive. The three examples given by UMD/NRRI were wolf packs, salamanders, and Jack-in-the-Pulpit (plants). Although difficult along the Iron Range, passage is still possible, but could be aided by thoughtful use of culverts big enough to allow wildlife safe passage under roads, and ensuring that the areas still passable are not removed from the landscape. Cumulative wetlands impacts have drastically increased in the past decade, with virtually all of the major destruction occurring along the Iron Range. The one exception occurred where fire had burned the land so intensely north of Iron Range that the top layer of moss and vegetation no longer support wetlands. Because the portion of the Iron Range that is in the 1854 Ceded Territory is all contained within the St. Louis River watershed, there are without a doubt cumulative impacts that would result from this Project that have not been identified or considered.",WI,NS,X,1,

This means that to exercise those rights, Band Members now have to harvest on one side or the other because there simply isn’t passage available without driving around the blockages.

Margaret Watkins,"In order to determine the impacts of a mine, the effectiveness of closure and reclamation after the mine is no longer in use must be assessed.227 But in the FEIS, there is little discussion regarding the type of financial assurance that would be used. The level of detail that is provided in the FEIS regarding the estimated amount of financial assurance that would be sufficient for reclamation, closure, mitigation, and remediation of adverse effects from the Project is based upon highly flawed, unscientific analyses of Project impacts. Even though the MNDNR has stated that PolyMet financial assurance will include clean-up costs for contamination resulting from LTVSMC operations,228 the FEIS provides no discussion regarding financial assurance that will be needed for the existing contamination associated with previous mining activities at the site.

Margaret Watkins,"In 2000, the Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) issued a critical report assessing how the Bureau of Land Management and the USFS land exchange program requirements had been implemented between 1989 and 1999 identifying several significant problems. The report states that: ...agencies did not ensure that the land was being appropriately valued, or that exchanges served the public interest, or met certain other exchange requirements. In view of the many problems in both agencies’ land exchange programs and given the fundamental difficulties that underlie land exchanges when compared with cash-based transactions, we believe that the Congress may wish to consider directing the Service and the Bureau to discontinue their land exchange programs. Again, in a 2009 review, the GAO found substantial problems implementing land exchanges. One-third of the 31 land exchanges examined had documented issues in the agency's public interest determination. 36 C.F.R. Section 254.3(a) provides “[t]he Secretary is not required to exchange any Federal lands.

Margaret Watkins,"Exchanging thousands of acres of diverse, high-quality land—land with some of the few remaining large game corridors in northeastern Minnesota that are available to the Bands to exercise reserved 1854 Treaty rights—for lands that have moderate diversity and lack big-game corridors is inconsistent with the fiduciary responsibilities that are shared by all federal agencies. The FEIS attempts to diminish the significance of the loss of these high-quality lands by stating that “[t]he 6,495.4 acres of federal lands are not accessible for public use via land, while substantial portions of the non-federal lands do have public access via public roads or hiking trails. This distinction is a factor in evaluating land use effects, because public access defines the degree to which the lands in question can actually be used...”239 But again, historic trails are key to the exercise of treaty rights and are of historic significance to the Bands connecting what is now Beaver Bay with Lake Vermillion. These trails “are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past”240 including John Beargrease,241 Peter Gagnon,242 and Alec Posey.243 In more recent history, Bois Forte Band members have used a sugarbush near the plant site and harvested wild rice in the Embarrass River near the LTVSMC tailings basin.244",LAN,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme LAN 05
Margaret Watkins,"Additionally, the FEIS does not provide adequate discussion of the adverse effects of the proposed land exchange on wetlands and headwater streams within the St. Louis River watershed and the Lake Superior Basin. The loss of first-order headwaters streams, second-order streams, and wetlands in the Basin have the potential to significantly adversely impact downstream water quality, fisheries, and wildlife that are important to the Bands. The proposed action land exchange would trade water resources within the Lake Superior Basin for wetlands and surface water outside the Lake Superior Basin and the St. Louis River watershed, although still within the 1854 Ceded Territory. Federal lands now provide 4,164 acres of wetlands within the Lake Superior Basin. Non-federal lands contain 4,669 acres of wetlands, of which 373 acres are within the Lake Superior Basin, demonstrating there would be a loss of 3,791 acres, or 90 percent of federally-managed wetlands within the Lake Superior Basin under the proposed exchange.245 It is well known that wetlands play an important role in the condition of downstream waters by retaining floodwaters, sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants, thereby benefitting the quality of downstream waters. Wetlands may also function as thermal refuge for moose when summertime temperatures exceed 14o C, the point at which moose become thermally stressed.246 Additionally, wetlands with aquatic vegetation provide an important forage resource for moose during the open-water season. Furthermore, the SDEIS acknowledged, as does the FEIS, that the Land Exchange Proposed Action would create a “net increase of third-order streams and decrease in first- and second-order streams which would likely add more habitat diversity to the Superior National Forest.”247 But the FEIS underestimates the impact of this increase, and ignores basic EPA guidance: “Headwater streams are the smallest parts of river and stream networks, but make up the majority of river miles in the United States. Many headwater streams have been lost or altered due to human activities ... and this can impact species and water quality downstream.”248 The FEIS states the net increase of third-order streams and decrease in second-order streams would likely add more habitat diversity to the Superior National Forest since, generally, stream habitat diversity increases with higher- order streams. No significant habitat changes would likely occur associated with the slight decreases in first-order, headwater streams; however, the net reduction to the Superior National Forest of 0.3 mile of first order streams may result in slightly less habitat available for headwater stream dependent species.249 While greater diversity is desirable, protection of headwater streams is critical because they powerfully influence both the character and functions of downstream waters. Headwater streams transport vegetation, woody debris, organic matter, macroinvertebrates, and other organisms downstream, while providing spawning areas for brook trout. Headwaters provide most of the water to rivers, which in turn provides temperature mitigation and oxygenation which are necessary for healthy fish communities.",WET,S,N,8,FEIS Section 5.3.6.2.2 pg. 5-741.

Margaret Watkins,"But the desire to resolve “conflict” between the USFS and Project proponent should not overshadow federal fiduciary responsibility to the Bands. The proponent wishes to develop an open pit mine but cannot due to deed restrictions on the federal estate because the surface estate was purchased by the USFS under the authority of the Weeks Act. More roads and hiking trails may provide more access to the public, but do nothing to promote habitat diversity and long-term ecosystem sustainability that are requirements for the preservation of tribal usufructuary rights. Further, habitat diversity that promotes long-term ecosystem sustainability represents a critical component of climate change adaptation to preserve and sustain tribal usufructuary rights. Although the land exchange proposed action may increase acreage in the federal estate, the loss of critical wildlife corridors, along with high quality and diverse land and water resources, directly connects the federal regulatory agencies’ trust responsibility to the Bands.

The Band’s and other Tribal Cooperating Agencies’ comments on the June 2008 PDEIS, the 2009 CPDEIS, the 2009 DEIS, and the 2013 SDEIS detailed the nature of these substantial cumulative impacts and the need for further analysis. Instead, as discussed, Grand Portage on its own was forced to hire UMD and NRRI in 2014 to do this critical work. Even as the USACE insisted that the only trust obligation to the Bands was “access,”they refused to evaluate this cumulative effect of mining in the 1854 Ceded Territory. And as stated previously, the Co-leads believe that the use of the 1854 Ceded Territory as the CEAA for cultural resources would diminish the significance of any cumulative effect.” This approach is entirely incorrect.

When the analyses were completed, the Co-Leads were invited to a presentation of the results held on November 9, 2015, at NRRI. The results of the study demonstrated that using the entire 1854 Ceded Territory as the CEAA did not diminish the significance of any cumulative effect. In fact, for each discrete area of analysis, the results demonstrated that by far the most pervasive cumulative impacts have resulted from iron mining.

Margaret Watkins,"The FEIS also fails to analyze cumulative effects on water quality and quantity, which has a particular impact on the 1854 Ceded Territory as a whole. The relevant spatial scale for water quality and hydrologic cumulative effects analysis is the entire St. Louis River watershed, and the Dunka River sub-watershed. These watersheds have experienced substantial historic, current, and proposed expanded mining activities, as well as other industrial, agricultural, and urban development. In addition to the direct surface water and wetland impacts (here meaning loss and/or degradation) from these activities, nearly half of the St. Louis River watershed has experienced hydrologic alteration from extensive ditching. This analysis is particularly important in light of the current expansion of mining (new copper-nickel projects and the expansion of existing taconite operations). It is reasonably foreseeable that an additional 3,000 acres of wetlands within the watershed will be directly impacted by proposed new mining projects and expansions that are in active permitting and/or environmental review: the Project, U.S. Steel Minntac mine expansion; U.S. Steel Keetac expansion; United Taconite Tailings Basin 3 construction; and Cliffs Northshore mine pit expansion. The FEIS also fails to adequately analyze cumulative impacts to the water quality of the Partridge and Embarrass Rivers, much less the St. Louis River. In fact, in Colby Lake (the community water supply for the City of Hoyt Lakes), aluminum, iron, copper, and mercury concentrations already exceed Minnesota WQS.257 Modeled concentrations of arsenic also exceed Minnesota WQS. This existing, large number of water-quality exceedences and the suite of constituents, particularly trace metals, that exceed WQS not only confirm the total lack of remediation for the previous mining activities at the LTVSMC site, but demonstrate the importance of evaluating the cumulative losses to water quality. Community drinking water wells, wetland degradation resulting from dewatering, and pollution of community and private drinking water aquifers by previous mining activity should have been assessed throughout the St. Louis River watershed and Dunka River sub-watershed as part of this Project, as well as for all the other mining projects currently underway. Instead, the FEIS concludes that the Project will meet MN WQS and that “the potential for exceedances of water quality evaluation criteria as a result of cumulative effects from the NorthMet Project Proposed Action and other reasonably foreseeable actions is considered unlikely.”258",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 024
Margaret Watkins,"The FEIS does not determine climate change implications of the proposed Project on the 1854 Ceded Territory (or anywhere). It only superficially discusses climate change impacts to circumpolar species.259 The FEIS also concludes that at the mine site low flow rates from the Pits to bedrock or surficial aquifers were not affected by the climate change and surface water quality won’t change much because all surface water discharged from the Mine Site would be treated by the WWTF.260 Similarly, climate change is not expected to cause significant changes in groundwater at the tailings basin, and surface water quality in the Embarrass River and its tributaries is expected to be minimally affected.261 In fact, the only real climate change effect noted is an increase in the amount of water that would need treatment at the WWTF.262 However, the Project has proposed the largest direct wetland fill ever permitted in this region and would disturb extensive areas of peat, which is known to be an important carbon and methane sink. Wetlands in general are recognized as important carbon sinks and areas where wildlife seeks refuge as the climate warms. Nevertheless, to date, virtually all required wetland mitigation for mining impacts has been implemented out of the basin, representing a permanent loss of high quality ecological resources and functions.263 This omission undermines even the MNDNR’s own work. The MNDNR’s Moose Advisory Committee, which studies the decline of the moose population in northeastern Minnesota, has recommended preserving wetlands as sanctuaries for moose from heat stress related to climate change.264 Furthermore, underestimation of storm size and frequency is a serious problem for capture and treatment of polluted water from the Category 1 waste rock pile and tailings basin, tailings basin stability, stormwater run-off from the Overburden Storage and Layout Area (“OSLA”), and mine pit dewatering. Storm size and frequency is known to be changing. However, the mean annual precipitation used to model climate change was 29.8 in/yr instead of the current from 28.1 inches per year, a change of only 1.7 inches which is less than a 6 percent increase. These and other cumulative effects of climate change should have been addressed.",AIR,S,O,2,"SDEIS Themes AIR 01, COE 03, WET 07, WET 13, WR 077, WR 180, WR 196"
Margaret Watkins,"Also missing is cumulative-impacts analysis of culturally-important plant and animal species that are listed as “Species of Concern.” For example, a substantial moose population has been identified in the mine site area by aerial and ground surveys. Moose are likely to be impacted by the disturbance of two of the few wildlife corridors remaining along the Mesabi Range, not to mention by the massive wetland impacts of this project. The rationale for a comprehensive cumulative impacts analysis for moose is found, again, in the MNDNR’s own statements. This Co-Lead itself, in its Statement of Need And Reasonableness (“SONAR”), related to Minnesota’s List of Endangered, Threatened, and Special Concern Species, in 2012 proposed listing moose as a species of “special concern:” Between 1990 and 2000, the northwestern Minnesota Moose population underwent a substantial decline, and a 2007 Minnesota DNR aerial survey determined that as of that date, fewer than 100 Moose comprised the northwestern population. Aerial surveys currently estimate the northeastern Minnesota population at roughly 4,230 individuals. The northwestern Minnesota Moose population decline occurred in less than a decade. Recent surveys document a slow decline in the northeastern Minnesota Moose population.266 MNDNR directly linked this decline to climate change, land ownership, and forest management practices: Increased temperatures are likely to increase heat stress and lead to increased mortality within the state’s remaining Moose populations. Changes in land ownership and changes in forest management practices within the state’s Moose range may be having a significant adverse effect on the quantity and quality of the species’ habitat within the state, and particularly on thermal refuges in warmer weather. The state’s northeastern Moose population has not shown as rapid a decline, but is very likely to be dramatically impacted by rising temperatures resulting from climate change. This will likely lead to a marked decline in this population within the foreseeable future.267 There is no basis to dispute that the Project will have cumulative effects on the moose herd and Tribal harvest in the 1854 Ceded Territory. At a time when moose populations in Minnesota are declining, this analysis is particularly important and should have been done as part of this FEIS.",WI,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WI 01

It includes only the Partridge and Embarrass Rivers from their headwaters to a point approximately 15.5 miles downstream of the Project Proposed Action Activities, where the rivers form the St. Louis River. In this Area, the MPCA has assessed and identified waterbodies that are impaired for fish and/or benthic macroinvertebrate communities based upon recent monitoring data (since 2009). But the draft 2012 Section 303(d) list prepared by the MPCA includes more headwaters streams and rivers in the St. Louis River watershed that are also impaired for aquatic communities.

In addition, the FEIS states that the current fish tissue concentration in five local lakes results in Hazard Quotients (“HQs”) that exceed 1,272 but provides scarce detail. The maximum incremental cumulative Hazard Quotient from the two reasonably foreseeable cumulative projects over existing fish mercury concentrations is 0.08 for recreational anglers, 0.61 for subsistence/tribal anglers, and 0.54 for subsistence fishers. This is only about a 0.3 to 1.8 percent increase over the existing incremental risk levels, for recreational, subsistence/tribal and subsistence anglers. Of this, the NorthMet Project Proposed Action would contribute approximately 59 to 92 percent of the incremental cumulative Hazard Quotient. In fact, Barr Engineering’s July 2012 “Cumulative Impacts Analysis, Local Mercury Deposition and Bioaccumulation in Fish”274 showed modeled contributions from both the Mesabi Nugget Large Scale Demonstration Plant (“LDSP”) on the site and PolyMet. And the Barr report further provides the actual HQs, rather than just saying “they exceed 1.” In one case, the existing HQ equals 46.2—which is 46 times as high as the number where action is recommended. This information should have been explicitly included in the FEIS for public review. The Project contribution of 59 to 92 percent of the incremental cumulative Hazard Quotient is significant.

And, the loss of mercury through adsorption to solids in the tailings basin and subsequent burial in the sediments resulted in an overall permanent retention of mercury within the basin and decreases the mercury load released to receiving waters.278 However, mercury in the existing Cell 2E pond of the LTVSMC tailings basin has a concentration of 1.4 ng/L of mercury and water collected seeping out of the toe of the tailings basin has a concentration of 4.9 ng/L.279 This contradicts the MNDNR280 by demonstrating that mercury concentrations after seeping through the tailings do not decrease, in fact the concentration more than triples.",MERC,S,N,8,See Thematic Response MERC 06. The comment correctly notes that mercury was picked up between the tailings basin and the well (collecting samples at the toe of the tailings basin). This is not surprising since mercury and methylmercury are commonly picked up by shallow groundwater that contacts organic matter in riparian/wetland settings.

Wendy Robertson,"Even if fully implemented and if all outcomes are as prescribed within the EIS, the impact may be legally acceptable and meet all the prevailing regulations, but such impacts will still remain unacceptable. Technology can cleverly change the form of such impacts but it cannot reduce their total as given by thermodynamic laws: all material transactions with the environment constitute impact and even if the site is restored there will necessarily remain an impact legacy; the extraction and concentration of copper/nickel and dissolved pollutants requires a compensating disordered waste stream, so that the chosen stream is that which is unregulated—namely CO2. Technology can never avoid a waste stream but it can only make it legal under our regulatory scheme. And the accumulation of such legal, incremental impacts over time will prove disastrous. And as this EIS sets a precedent for the opening of a host of such projects, there is effectively no limit to total impact, especially atmospheric carbon. Without a regulatory cap on such wastes, this plan merely sanctions future calamity. More generally, this plan is misleading in that the public erroneously believes that it is a map for impact-less mining, for “getting it right.” The reality is that all such economic growth inevitably and incrementally adds to the planet’s impact load, the total of which is increasingly imposing costs on the public. Since environmental costs accelerate as a function of aggregate impact, and since the EIS evaluates costs as a function of impact in isolation, it concludes that the cost/benefit ratio is favorable, where in reality it is not. Therefore the underlying problem with the EIS is its failure to recognize our collective predicament: we have exceeded carrying capacity and further economic growth results in negative returns wherein costs exceed benefits, which make us worse off rather that better off, make us poorer rather than richer. Secondly this document fails to detail an enforcement plan, without which it is useless. This is especially problematic if the land trade is enacted, as the property will be immediately fenced, gated, and guarded. Ownership confers power and a split estate is the best guarantor of the public’s interest, ensuring enforcement of both process and outcome, as prescribed by the EIS.

Dana Bloom,"1) The state needs direct access to core samples. During my work with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), in the Hibbing Lands and Minerals office, where the mining companies store their core samples, my supervisor told me that core samples drilled by mining companies are considered confidential/propriety information; DNR staff are not allowed to view the core. Mining companies drill and examine thousands upon thousands of feet of core, much more than the state could possibly drill and examine independently. Since the state is unable to replicate the magnitude and detail of a mining company’s drilling and rock core study, and since DNR staff is not allowed to view the mining companies’ core, the state is unable to independently verify, with any certainty, the accuracy of the mining companies’, and third party contractors’, claims. The existing EIS relies too heavily on other party’s interpretation of data, and too little on direct observation of raw data specific to this mine plan. The state should be allowed to view rock core samples and verify mining company claims. Not viewing the actual core samples, obtained by mining companies, for this specific mining project, is the equivalent of deciding to purchase a house after only being allowed to tour a couple of neighbors’ attics and read the realtor’s description. The state cannot determine the EIS is adequate, or accurate, without being allowed to view the core samples from which the conclusions in the EIS are drawn.",WAT,S,N,3,"SDEIS Theme WR 026. To support mine planning and waste-rock handling, PolyMet developed a geologic “block model,” which is a three-dimensional grid that represents the deposit and that provides an estimate for ore grade and sulfide S concentration in each grid block. The estimates of sulfide S in NorthMet waste and ore are based on interpolation of sulfide S analyzed in recovered drill core (approximately 18,800 analyzed samples). To ensure that the estimates of sulfide S concentration in the waste rock are accurate, the Co-lead Agencies commissioned an independent review of the geostatistical analysis used to develop the sulfide S distribution in the block model. For this, the reviewer obtained the entire dataset of sulfide S analyses on core samples. This audit found that the number and spatial distribution of the sulfide analyzed supported the geologic block model, which was developed to describe the ore and waste rock distribution in the deposit (Optitech 2012)."
Dana Bloom,"2) Environmental impact of weak ability, on part of regulators, to enforce mining and environmental rules. There are a number of scenarios in which the state, and other agencies, may be unable to effectively enforce mining and environmental rules; the environmental impacts of these scenarios should be included in the EIS. Neglecting to outline the role, or absence of action, on the part of the state and other regulators, in monitoring, enforcing and controlling environmental impacts implies that the mining companies will regulate themselves. Effective state enforcement results in substantially different environmental impacts compared to scenarios where companies regulate themselves; these differences, and ways to maximize regulatory effectiveness, need to be addressed to ensure obstacles to the state’s ability to effectively enforce rules are minimized. What assurances currently exist that the state is capable of effectively enforcing rules to minimize adverse environmental impacts? Vehicle track out on highway 169, between Grand Rapids and the Chisholm area (during active scram mining), shows the state’s current lack of success in enforcing environmental rules with current mining companies. It seems like preventing iron ore dust/mud from leaving a mine site on truck tires, would be relatively easy to enforce, compared to enforcing the host of complicated environmental regulations introduced with a copper nickel operation. If the state cannot effectively enforce the existing rules, how can the public be assured the state would have better success with a more complex mining operation?",NEPA,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes NEPA 09, NEPA 15"

In addition, some residents of Keewatin had to have their homes repainted due to the airborne red iron ore dust. Mine workers laundry rooms accumulate iron ore dust. Iron ore dust might not pose a potential risk for family members, but what are the environmental and health effects of liberated copper nickel mine waste/dust? I have logged rock core from the Duluth Complex, and identified minerals that have asbestos-like crystals/fibers; I have pictures of these fibers. Has the state reviewed images of, or core samples containing, asbestos-like fibers from the Duluth Complex? If not, it strikes me as an inadequate review of environmental impacts. Mine operators are supposed to reduce vehicle track out, and they make efforts to do so; however, despite their efforts, and despite government rules and regulations, highway 169 is frequently is stained red. If the state cannot currently prevent iron ore dust from leaving mine sites, how is the state going to prevent possible asbestos-like materials from leaving mine sites? What obstacles have prevented regulators from effectively addressing these environmental impacts?",AIR,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes AIR 05, AIR 09, HU 03. The NorthMet"
Dana Bloom,"What are some possible scenarios in which the regulators are unable to effectively control environmental impacts through regulation? A. Lack of funding for adequate regulatory staff B. Staff, empowered to make decisions, who lack the interpersonal, intrapersonal, technical skill and knowledge, and material resources to carry out effective inspections and the corresponding follow-up tasks - For example, staff might lack the ability to remain unbiased after working closely with industry representatives for years, developing friendly relationships and wanting to avoid conflict and confrontation when put into a position of having to address rule infractions. Empowered individuals within government agencies, make decisions that substantially impact the environment. As individual decisions relate to government agencies abilities to regulate PolyMet, what effective procedures does the state have in place to ensure that individual regulatory employees consistently maintain congruence between the regulatory objectives and their actions, and that they are not influenced by personal agendas (like wanting to reduce personal work load or avoid conflict with colleagues or industry)? C. Poor communication between and within regulatory agencies This comment is not about asbestos or air-quality; this comment is about the state’s lack of ability to enforce existing rules, the impact on the environment of poor enforcement, and the need for the EIS to address environmental consequences of weak government agency enforcement in order to be considered adequate.",NEPA,S,N,3,"SDEIS Theme NEPA 15. NEPA (as well as MEPA) recognize that EISs are planning tools that focus agency analyses on significant environmental issues (40 CFR 1501.1(d)). As a tool, an EIS analyzes proposals at an appropriate level, given that the permitting process would require more finely tuned analyses based on further understanding of environmental conditions and project design. This means that the NEPA and MEPA phase of the environmental review process requires less specificity for proposed projects, and demands additional detail for the permitting phase. Pursuant to NEPA and MEPA, mitigation measures and their effectiveness have been considered in the EIS. The actual effectiveness of any approved and implemented mitigation measures would be monitored as part of permit conditions, which may lead to additional mitigation measures being required of the permit holder."

The Center for Biological Diversity (Center) is a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 900,000 members and online activists dedicated to the protection of endangered species and wild places. The Center has an office in Duluth, Minnesota, and has hundreds of members who reside within and/or regularly use, enjoy, and recreate on public lands and waters in northeastern Minnesota, including on the Superior National Forest. The Center, its staff, and its members and the interests of its staff and members would be significantly harmed and injured if the proposed project is approved and allowed to be implemented. Earthjustice is a non-profit environmental law organization, defending the right to a healthy environment for all, using the law to fight for the earth and its inhabitants since the early 1970s. Earthjustice works with individuals and organizations to realize that mission and ensure the implementation and enforcement of our environmental laws. The mission of the Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness is to protect, preserve and restore the wilderness character of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and the Quetico-Superior Ecosystem. We have nearly 3,000 members in Minnesota and across the United States, and regularly communicate with about 27,000 supporters. Our organization values healthy ecosystems, clean water, wilderness character, and primitive recreation. Our supporters enjoy the Superior National Forest and the BWCAW for canoeing, camping, fishing, hunting, bird-watching, and many other reasons, as well as the region’s natural, largely-undeveloped character. The risks to many of these activities and attributes from nonferrous mining have been a significant concern for our organization for many years. The Friends of the Cloquet Valley State Forest is a 501(c)(3) non profit organization dedicated to the protection and preservation of the natural and cultural resources of the Cloquet Valley State Forest and promotes responsible enjoyment of this unique treasure. The Cloquet River flows through our forest and into the St. Louis River. The people and the flora and fauna of the Cloquet River Valley are intimately connected with the fate of our river. Our members’ concerns range from the health of the people to the legacy of the land, water and ecosystem we leave to the coming generations. Many of us make our livings by relying upon sustainable tourism, the natural world, art, and agriculture, and anything that disrupts the ecosystem is a threat to our livelihoods and well being. The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MCEA) is a Minnesota-based non-profit environmental organization, the legal and scientific voice protecting and preserving Minnesota’s wildlife, natural resources, and the health of its people. MCEA has members across the state of Minnesota, some of whom live and recreate near the proposed mine. The proposed NorthMet project has environmental implications for many of the areas of MCEA’s work, including water quality, natural resources, energy policy and public health. Northeastern Minnesotans for Wilderness (NMW) is a nonprofit regional conservation organization whose core mission is to advocate for the preservation and protection of public lands, designated wilderness areas, national parks, national forests, and other wild places in the Minnesota Arrowhead Region, especially the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the Superior National Forest, and the Quetico-Superior ecosystem. Since its founding in 1996, NMW has grown to represent over 2400 members and supporters, almost all of whom live in Minnesota. The majority of our members and supporters reside year-round or seasonally in the three-county Minnesota Arrowhead Region, own property in the three-county area, and will be directly impacted by the NorthMet Project. Our members and supporters also visit and recreate throughout the three-county area. Save Our Sky Blue Waters (SOS) is a Duluth-based grassroots non-profit organization dedicated to protecting our region’s waters, forests and wildlife. SOS formed in response to proposed copper-nickel sulfide mining and exploration in Minnesota's Arrowhead region and the headwaters of Lake Superior and throughout the Superior National Forest. The health of the St. Louis River watershed is a key component of our mission. SOS is a non-profit public interest environmental education and advocacy organization. The issue of potential toxic sulfide mining in northeast Minnesota may greatly impact our organization and citizens across the region. The Sierra Club is a national nonprofit organization of approximately 600,000 members dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of the earth to practicing and promoting the responsible use of the earth’s ecosystems and resources to educating and enlisting humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment and to using all lawful means to carry out these objectives. The Club’s particular interest in this case stems from the proposed project’s potential impacts on Minnesota’s natural resources and public health, including risks to water quality, loss of wetlands, harm to wildlife, and cumulative impacts from mining. The North Star Chapter of the Sierra Club has approximately 14,292 members in the state of Minnesota. The mission of Voyageurs National Park Association is to protect and promote the natural, recreational, and historic resources of Minnesota's Voyageurs National Park. VNPA and our supporters across the state serve as a voice for this water-based national park and its nearly 250,000 annual visitors who enjoy kayaking, canoeing, boating, camping, and fishing there each year, and contribute more than $16 million to the local economy. The proposed NorthMet project, individually and cumulatively, may have dramatic environmental implications for the water quality and health of the fish and wildlife in Voyageurs and Northern Minnesota. These implications necessitate sound science and analysis. Since its founding in 1919, the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) has been the independent, nonpartisan voice working to strengthen and protect our nation’s natural, historical, and cultural heritage. Together with its more than one million members and supporters nationwide, including 20,000 in the state of Minnesota, it uses the legislative system, the power of public opinion, and the courts to shape public policy to protect national parks. The proposed NorthMet project has environmental implications for national parks in Minnesota. Additionally, NPCA is a co-chair of the Healing Our Waters Great Lakes restoration coalition, which has successfully advocated to establish and sustain the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), which has helped improve the water quality of all of the Great Lakes. The NorthMet project would be located within the Lake Superior watershed and pose an ongoing pollution threat to Lake Superior long after the proposed mining period stops.

It is unclear why DNR would not have used its own consulting firm, ERM, or its own employees to complete at least some of the extensive work done by Barr and PolyMet, given that PolyMet bears the costs. It gives the reader the general impression that, in the wake of public comments on the SDEIS, the Co-Lead Agencies simply asked the project proponent for additional work to defend its project in the FEIS, rather than the Co-Lead Agencies making an effort to give serious consideration or independent evaluation to comments.",NEPA,S,O,5,SDEIS Theme NEPA 08

Erin Mittag,"All predictions made by the FEIS regarding activities after closure, including but not limited to reclamation, mitigation measures, water treatment, transitions to new technology including reverse osmosis (RO) at the Waste Water Treatment Facility (WWTF) are unsupported without analysis of financial assurance. This FEIS also relies to an extraordinary degree on “adaptive management” strategies—used incorrectly here as merely monitoring plans with general descriptions of potential strategies that could be used if problems arise—that will require action after Year 20, when PolyMet says it will cease mining operations. But adaptive management strategies can only be deployed if there is money to pay for them. Thus, all adaptive management strategies identified in the FEIS are also unsupported without specific financial assurance information.",FIN,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"Dr. Chambers elaborated on the specific legal and scientific obligations of an agency overseeing environmental review of a mining operation to provide financial assurance details. In addition, the Conservation Organizations have attached an example of an EIS with adequate financial assurance details, the FEIS for the Idaho Cobalt Mine. The Co-Lead Agencies have continually alleged that there is no obligation to provide financial assurance information until permitting.7 The FEIS states that “[n]either NEPA nor MEPA rules require that all financial assurance mechanisms be in place before the EIS is finalized.” However, the Co-Lead Agencies misstate concern here. The Conservation Organizations are not suggesting that any financial assurance mechanisms should be in place before the EIS is finalized.

Erin Mittag,"The FEIS is limited to statements that there will be a financial assurance package of some sort, and that it will meet the requirements of Minnesota Rules. If this was all the information required for an EIS to assess potential impacts and mitigation measures, than an EIS could be quite short. The section on water quality impacts, for instance, could simply state that the mine is governed by the Clean Water Act and therefore will not violate any water quality standards or other state or federal laws. But that is not how adequate EISs are written. Rather, under state and federal law, EISs must provide substantive analysis and scientific support for their statements. It is not enough to allege that the project will have no impact because it will comply with the law; if the FEIS concludes that the project will have no significant impact, the FEIS must demonstrate that the project is designed to comply with the law, and capable of minimizing potential impacts to support its statements. The reason for this is that NEPA is designed to be more than a box to be checked by agencies; an EIS is an action-forcing document designed to ensure that agencies have thoroughly studied the impacts of a project before making any irretrievable commitment of resources.",NEPA,S,N,8,"SDEIS Themes FIN 05, FIN 06.

Erin Mittag,"NEPA requires agencies to “study, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal that involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.” “An agency must look at every reasonable alternative, with the range dictated by the nature and scope of the proposed action.” MEPA similarly requires that an EIS “compare the potentially significant impacts of the proposal with those of other reasonable alternatives to the proposed project.” Additionally, the Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material “if there is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem.” Where a proposed action is not “water dependent,” practicable alternatives that avoid special aquatic sites are presumed to be available, unless clearly demonstrated otherwise. In other words, the permit applicant bears the burden of showing that no practicable alternatives with less adverse impact are available. The alternatives section is considered “the heart” of an EIS. The Co-Lead Agencies are expected to “[r]igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives” and “[d]evote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail including the proposed action so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits.”",ALT,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"The NorthMet environmental review process identified underground mining as an alternative for assessment, but the Co- lead Agencies ruled it out. They concluded “that the Underground Mining Alternative is not . . . a reasonable alternative because it would not be economically viable and therefore it would also not meet the Purpose and Need.” This conclusion rests on errors and discrepancies in the estimates of mining costs, as explained below. Furthermore, the FEIS states that “the geology outside of the open pit has not been characterized enough to support a mine plan and is beyond the boundaries of the NorthMet Project area, so it is not reasonable to include for consideration of the Underground Mining Alternative.” This statement is not true. While PolyMet may not yet have prepared a mine plan or assessed the economic viability of resources outside of the pit envelope, the geology for at least some of these resources is characterized enough to support a mine plan should PolyMet choose to prepare one. And while we do not find a specific definition of the “NorthMet Project area” in the FEIS, it is generally treated as including the entire area designated as the “mine site.” At least some of the additional mineralization that is well-characterized is found within what the FEIS shows as the project area. The determination that an underground mine is not a reasonable alternative is not supported by the evidence. This issue was raised in our comments on the SDEIS at MCEA 2, 33-35, Friends 2, 48, 51-52; and CBD 108-110.

Erin Mittag,"The basis of the FEIS’s economic analysis is quite simple: a value was calculated for the amount of ore to be mined on the one hand, and for the total costs of mining that ore on the other. If the costs were greater than the value of the ore, the mine was deemed not economically viable. The FEIS analyzed five mining rates ranging from 2000 tons per day to 15,000 tons per day.22 To simplify the following discussion, we focus on the 7500 tons-per-day scenario because that is the scenario with the most positive economics according to the FEIS analysis.23 The Co-lead Agencies presented an overall loss for this scenario of $168 million.24 It appears that all of the numbers used in the Co-Lead Report were taken directly from Foth Infrastructure & Environment, LLC, Economic Assessment of Conceptual Underground Mining Option for the NorthMet Project (Oct. 2012) (hereinafter, Foth 2012), which was prepared on behalf of PolyMet and is also provided in Appendix B of the FEIS.",ALT,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS divides total estimated costs of mining into operating costs and pre-production capital costs.26 Operating costs on a per-ton basis are provided in Table 1 of the Co-Lead Report. At the 7500 ton-per-day level, total operating costs are estimated at $49.00 per ton, and pre-production capital costs are estimated at $250 million total. Foth 2012 divides operating costs into three components: mining costs, processing costs, and general and contingency costs.28 The Foth 2012 report estimates costs for the 2000 and 5000 ton scenarios, and then adjusts these for the larger scenarios.29 To arrive at its estimates, Foth drew from several sources, including InfoMine (an online model commonly used by the industry), examples from other mines drawn from 43-101 reports filed on SEDAR, and a memo prepared for this purpose by AGP Mining Consultants Inc. (AGP), which has done much of PolyMet’s engineering work.",ALT,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"For mining costs, the Foth 2012 report provides cost estimates for both room-and-pillar mining and long-hole open stoping. Many of the estimates did not include cemented backfill, although Foth states “Cemented backfill typically represents roughly 20 percent of mining costs.”31 The report settles on a mining cost of $40 per ton for the 5000 tons-per-day scenario. This amount is significantly higher than any estimate from any source used in the Foth 2012 report. The only source that estimates mining costs above $30 per ton for the 5000 tons-per-day scenario is the AGP Memo, which Foth reports as $44 to $52 at 5000 tons per day for long-hole stoping.32 However, the AGP Memo provides this figure for total operating costs (including processing and administrative),33 while the Foth 2012 report uses it for mining costs only.

Erin Mittag,"Using its $40-per-ton estimate for the 5000 ton-per-day scenario, Foth estimated $33-per-ton for a 7500 ton-per-day scenario. This amounts to a 17.5 percent reduction. Using the same percentage reduction for the maximum cost estimate from any source ($33.50, the maximum amount in the AGP memo) gives a figure of $27.64 per ton. Once again, in the context of eliminating an alternative from NEPA review based on economics, the lower (or at least average) cost estimates should be used, and this estimate is still on the high end of the various figures given by Foth 2012. We also point out that AGP does not provide a basis for its estimates; as far as we can tell, there is no support for its estimates in the record. Nonetheless, for the sole purpose of showing that the economic analysis included in the FEIS does not indicate an operating loss for at least one scenario, we will use $27.64 as an estimated mining cost. The second of the three categories of costs included in total operating costs is processing costs. Foth adopts the InfoMine processing cost for a three-concentrate flotation mill of $13 per ton at 5000 tons per day, after noting comparable values at Copperwood in Michigan ($11.75 per ton) and Lac des Iles in Thunder Bay ($14 per ton). It goes on to scale this to $12.50 per ton for the 7500 tons-per-day level. Remarkably, the report ignores PolyMet’s own processing cost estimate for processing ore from the open pit, which is $6.99 per ton.42 We were unable to extrapolate this to a smaller operation because of unknown scaling factors, but would expect this to be considered in a legitimate economic analysis. The last of the three categories of operating costs is administrative costs. Because different mines label this category differently, it is difficult to compare the numbers from various sources. Foth does not provide an InfoMine estimate for this cost. The examples provided include $3.30 for general and $2.00 for contingency per ton at Lac des Iles (presumably for a total of $5.30 per ton); and $3.35 per ton for general and administrative at Copperwood. The report settles on an estimate of $3.50 per ton.43 This cost apparently does not change based on tonnage; the same cost-per-ton is used in all scenarios. Again, the report completely ignores PolyMet-specific information, which estimates “general and administrative” cost for the open pit mine at $0.66 per ton. Using the numbers discussed above, Foth 2012 reaches a total of $56.50 per ton for total operating costs at the 5000 ton-per-day level, and $49 per ton at the 7500 ton-per-day level. Based on the above discussion, these estimates are clearly inflated. Even if the processing and administrative costs are not adjusted based on PolyMet’s own estimates, and the only correction made is for the discrepancy in the AGP figures, the estimate at the 7500 ton-per-day level would be $42.64.",ALT,S,N,8,"The value is $27.64 for 7500.

Erin Mittag,"Capital costs are also significantly overstated because they fail to account for the savings that PolyMet will achieve due to the use of an existing processing plant. Rather than using PolyMet-specific information, estimates were based on industry costs drawn from InfoMine. Foth provides separate InfoMine estimates for mine capital costs and processing plant capital costs. The Foth 2012 report estimated mine capital costs at 7500 tons per day at $125 million for room-and-pillar mining without backfill (adding 20 percent gives $150 million) and $115 million for long-hole stoping with sand backfill (adding 20 percent gives $138 million).46 For the processing plant, Foth 2012 provides an InfoMine estimate for a three-concentrate flotation mill of $98 million at the 7500 tons-per-day level, which Foth adopts as its estimated processing plant cost.47 However, PolyMet provides an estimate of its own processing plant at 32,000 tons per day, which is $63 million.48 The significantly lower cost is the primary savings that PolyMet will achieve by using an existing processing plant. Again there are scaling considerations; the total capital cost at 7500 tons-per-day should be lower than the cost at 32,000 tons per day. However, again solely for the purpose of this discussion we will use the $63 million estimate. Foth also added a contingency amount of approximately 10 percent to the mine and process plant capital costs to calculate the total capital costs.49 Adding 10 percent contingency gives a total capital cost of $234 million for long-hole stoping. This is in comparison to a $250 million estimate used by Foth and the Co-lead agencies.",ALT,S,N,8,"At the 7,500 tons/day production rate for long-hole stoping with cemented backfill, it is unclear how the commenter arrived at $234 million capital cost based upon this comment.

Erin Mittag,"To be clear, we are not arguing that the amount presented here is an appropriate estimate of underground mining. We think that that estimate would be significantly less based on a number of factors described above for which we have made no adjustment. Our only purpose here is to show that after correcting only the two most obvious discrepancies in the economic analysis prepared by Foth, the analysis does not show a loss at the 7500 ton-per-day level.

Erin Mittag,"The existence of ore outside the pit envelope is a critical factor in determining whether an underground mine will be economical, because limitation to the pit envelope artificially limits the amount of ore of a particular grade that is available for mining. Co-Lead Report Table 2 provides net metal value for the five mining scenarios. Dividing this number by the total tons to be mined provides a value per ton. This exercise reveals that at the lower production rates, the minerals to be extracted have a higher per-ton value. The range is from $60.40 per ton for the 5 million ton scenario to $41.42 per ton for the 100 million ton scenario. These values are apparently based on how much ore there is in the pit envelope for each of the net metal values. That is, there are 5 million tons of mineable ore within the pit envelope with an average metal content worth $60.40 per ton; 30 million tons with an average metal content worth $51.73 per ton; and 50 million tons with an average metal content worth $47.72 per ton. Including mineralization beyond the pit envelope would affect the amount of ore available at each net-value-per-ton level. As an example, assume that the mine could be extended into an area that would provide 50 percent more ore of a given grade than is available within the pit envelope. The outcome would be that, for example, 30 million tons of ore would grade at $53.85 per ton (the Co-Lead Report Table 2 net metal value per ton for 20 million tons of ore) rather than $51.73 per ton. Mining costs might go up somewhat due to the increased area to be mined, but other costs would remain the same. This could add up to $2.12 per ton in net value, or a total of $60 million to the mine’s profit in the 7500 tons-per-year scenario. AGP prepared both the mine plan and PolyMet’s NI 43-101 Technical Report, and thus is very knowledgeable about the NorthMet deposit. The AGP report for the underground mining economic analysis provides the following table, which indicates that for one 5000 ton-per-day scenario, more than half of the economic ore lies outside of the proposed pit: A graphic representation is also provided: In light of this evidence, Foth 2012 goes into several obfuscations as to why an economic assessment of an underground mine should be limited only to the ore in the proposed pit. The obfuscation begins with Foth’s special definition of “NorthMet deposit” for the purposes of the Underground Mining analysis: “The term NorthMet deposit used in this report will refer to NI 43-101 compliant measured and indicated mineral resources within the open pit.” The Co-Lead Agencies use information straight from the Foth 2012 report without mentioning this special definition. They thus state “The NorthMet deposit is considered to be a near-surface, bulk, low-grade mineralization,” when the reality is that most of the mineralization at the NorthMet site is not near-surface. For example, “NorthMet consists of seven igneous units that dip southeast, with most economic sulfide mineralization in the lowermost unit.”53 And: Though grades vary, Unit 1 is also mineralized to the east of the deposit, down-dip (south) to depths of at least 2,500 feet, and past the limits of expected pit development in the west. The development of waste rock stockpiles over these areas is not expected to encumber any material that could reasonably be classed as ore because the upper units are barren and the Unit 1 mineralization is from 1,700 to over 2,500 feet below ground surface. Furthermore, the statement in the FEIS that “the geology outside of the open pit has not been characterized enough to support a mine plan” is flatly untrue for at least some areas. According to PolyMet’s 2013 43-101 SEDAR filing, ore within the pit envelope accounts for “significantly less than half of measured and indicated resources. Under Canadian regulations, “measured” and “indicated” resources are used to estimate the economic viability of a potential mine. The focus of the Foth 2012 report on the identification of “mineral reserves” as a limiting factor is just another obfuscation; the term “mineral reserves” carries no additional meaning in regard to the level of characterization of the geology. Rather, “mineral reserves” simply indicates measured and indicated resources for which a mining company has prepared an economically viable mine plan. The reality is that the only reason that the economic assessment for underground mining of the NorthMet deposit has been limited to the ore within the pit envelope is because this is the ore that PolyMet plans to mine in its first stage of open pit mining. Mineral reserves were delineated based on economics and other factors specific to open pit methods. This has nothing to do with the level of characterization of the geology. And using the same specified ore body to assess the economic viability of underground mining is an exercise designed to fail. Measured and indicated resources do not become mineral reserves until a mine company has a mine plan showing that they can be mined economically using a particular mining method. To put it another way, with regard to an underground mine, minerals within the pit envelope can no more be referred to as “mineral reserves” than can those outside of the pit envelope. Cutting the assessment off at the boundary of the proposed pit is completely arbitrary. The Foth 2012 report is at best disingenuous in its explanation of the deposit and what is known about it: There is mineralized rock outside of the volume of rock contained within the proposed open-pit. This mineralized rock occurs below the open-pit. While this mineralized rock is excluded from this report, speculatively it may be possible for it to be economically viable to extract decades in the future. Only approximately 10% of the measured and indicated resource is below the open-pit. Compare this to the statement from PolyMet’s SEDAR filing quoted above: “The pit plan is not fully optimized and the 20-year permit application covers significantly less than half of the measured and indicated resources.” The SEDAR filing reports measured and indicated resources of 442 to 694 million tons. Mineral reserves (i.e., measured and indicated resources within the pit envelope) are reported at 274.7 million tons. Perhaps the Foth 2012 statement can be regarded as technically true if only 10 percent of measured and indicated resources lie directly underneath the planned pit; however it is clearly not true that only 10 percent of the measured and indicated resources are located outside the pit envelope at a depth amenable to underground mining. Foth 2012 goes on to discuss “inferred resource” to further confuse matters: “The majority of inferred resource defined by PolyMet (2008) is below the open-pit. There is a lack of geological data to characterize the deep mineralized rock that in turn results in a lack of geological confidence leading to the inferred classification.” Once again, this may be technically true as applied only to the inferred resources, and yet misleading in regard to measured and indicated resources. In other words, the presence of inferred resources at depth does not mean that significant amounts of measured and indicated resources are not also present at depth. While it is likely true that PolyMet has insufficient information for some areas of mineralization to include them in an economic analysis, it is also true that there are mineralized areas outside of the mine pit for which it does have sufficient information. In the 1970’s U.S. Steel (USS) engaged in a very extensive program of drilling to define an underground mining resource. According to PolyMet’s geology background document “There is every indication that the sampling and analytical work performed by USS was thorough, professional, of a high standard, and reliable.” All of the USS drill core and data is available to PolyMet, and much of it is in PolyMet’s database. As of 2007, USS had obtained more linear feet of drill core and had drilled almost as many holes as PolyMet. The USS drilling was all done with the intent of developing an underground mine, and is thus concentrated in the areas where mineralization was known to be greatest at depth. While about 50 percent of the USS drill core has not yet been assayed, it is available at the Coleraine Minerals Research Laboratory. NEPA requires agencies to undertake necessary research when important relevant information is not readily available but could be obtained. Refusing to assess an important and potentially viable alternative based on lack of information when the missing information is obtainable does not comply with NEPA.",NEPA,S,N,8,"FEIS Section 1.3.2.4. The purpose of the proposed project is to produce base and precious metals precipitates and flotation concentrates from ore mined at the NorthMet Deposit, which is the deposit proposed to be mined by PolyMet."
Erin Mittag,"As a final note, we object to the lack of documentation of the figures provided by Foth and accepted by the agencies. We do not object to the use of InfoMine for estimated costs; in fact we think that it is a more reliable source than analog mines chosen at the discretion of PolyMet’s contractor, who has every reason to identify the costliest mines possible for the analysis. However, it is unclear how or why the InfoMine figures that were included were chosen. For example, underground mine cost data available from InfoMine includes production rates up to 45,000 tons per day.68 The analysis needs to explain why Foth limited its InfoMine estimates to the 5000 ton-per-day level and used its own scaling factors (which also need explanation) for the larger scenarios. Throughout the exercise, the Foth cost estimates are given with no explanation as to why any particular number was settled on. For each parameter, the Foth 2012 report lists figures from different sources, and then comes up with a number without any explanation or reasoning. It justifies those numbers by comparisons to other mines, but provides no explanation of why the mines used were chosen. The costs from analog mines are consistently higher than those from InfoMine, which is commonly used by the industry and would provide a less biased assessment. It is also unclear what information either Foth or the agencies rely on for statements relating to characterization of the ore body. For example, where is the data indicating that the NorthMet deposit is a “shallow” ore body, or that less than 10 percent of the measured and indicated resource is below the open pit? If the Co-lead agencies in fact did any independent evaluation of the Foth report, they need to make their analysis transparent. NEPA requires that the underlying data that forms the basis of conclusions in the FEIS be made available to the public.69 The obfuscations and biased analysis of PolyMet’s contractor and the failure of the Co-lead Agencies to properly review the contractor’s work or perform their own independent analysis has resulted in the summary rejection of an alternative that could result in significantly less environmental harm than the proposed project, in violation of NEPA, MEPA, and the Clean Water Act. Before going forward toward permitting an open pit mine and all the destruction that entails, the agencies must take an honest, hard look at the possibility that an underground mine might be a viable option.",ALT,S,N,3,"Comment noted. Section 2.0 of the September 2013 Underground Mining Alternative Assessment identifies that alternative was screened against five (5) criteria, including economic feasibility and project purpose and need. DNR reviewed the Proposer's cost assessment of developing and operating an underground mine at the NorthMet deposit as defined for the project.

Erin Mittag,"The Co-Lead Agencies failed to take a “hard look” at this alternative, instead eliminating it as an alternative without substantive analysis.70 (MCEA 2, 33, 35–39; Friends 2, 49–52; CBD 110–111) Under NEPA, the FEIS must: examine all reasonable alternatives to the proposal. In determining the scope of alternatives to be considered, the emphasis is on what is “reasonable” rather than on whether the proponent or applicant likes or is itself capable of carrying out a particular alternative. Reasonable alternatives include those that are practical or feasible from the technical and economic standpoint and using common sense, rather than simply desirable from the standpoint of the applicant.71 The Co-Lead Agencies claimed that the West Pit backfill would not provide substantial environmental benefits. Yet they concede that “the opportunity to reclaim wetlands vegetation at the Category 1 Stockpile footprint area and not having to treat seepage from the Category 1 Stockpile” would be “measurable environmental benefits offered by backfilling the Category 1 Stockpile into the West Pit.”72 Nevertheless, the Co-Lead Agencies eliminated the alternative for consideration based on several factors, which are addressed below:",ALT,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"Backfilling would affect the water quality in the West Pit by increasing constituent loads, so additional mechanical treatment of water in the West Pit may be required for a certain timeframe following backfilling. However, there would be no effect on surface water quality discharged to the environmental because mechanical treatment of water from the West Pit would still be required in the long term. Response: Backfilling may actually decrease required mechanical water treatment at the site because it eliminates the Category 1 stockpile, currently identified as an indefinite source of pollution. It is hard to imagine how the treatment in the West Pit as a result of a backfill could be longer than the projected time for treatment of the Category 1 stockpile. Additionally, the potential for additional mechanical treatment is speculative at best, as the Co-Lead Agencies did not attempt any modeling to support this hypothesis. Submerging the Category 1 stockpile would remove the last permanent stockpile on the site, improving aesthetics and potentially allowing greater recreational use of the site after closure. ● Moving the waste rock from the stockpile into the West Pit would result in prolonged dust, air, and noise emissions, but these would be unlikely to exceed the respective maximum years modeled during operations. Response: Noise, dust and air emissions are only an issue during operations; perpetual active water treatment and the aesthetics of the site remain for centuries after closure. Any advantages in the latter would certainly outweigh this minimal impact.● Backfilling the West Pit would encumber private mineral resources that are deeper than the proposed West Pit. Such an encumbrance is in conflict with the terms of PolyMet’s current private mineral leases. The PolyMet lease agreements could be renegotiated, which might involve monetary compensation for the mineral owners if the minerals are encumbered. Response: As Conservation Organizations noted in 2014, PolyMet has not provided any support for this claim, including a copy of any lease or other contract. PolyMet has also not provided any support for the notion that this pit could or would be remined, something that is quite unusual.75 It would be far more likely that PolyMet or another entity would choose to expand the proposed mine deeper, perhaps into an underground mine, rather than close and reclaim the site, if the minerals underneath were found to be economically desirable. Moreover, PolyMet’s current reclamation plan also encumbers deeper mineral rights, probably beyond reach without extraordinary expense. Dr. Myers notes that to access these minerals after reclamation, “the large volume of pit lake water will need to be entirely pumped and treated to meet the 10 mg/l sulfate requirement, and the cost and time required for pumping and treating the entire pit lake prior to remining effectively eliminates this as a possibility.”76 The presence of polluted water that must be pumped and treated before discharge may be a greater burden than simply digging out additional rock.● [B]ecause of the temporal effect that the stockpile would have, the [wetlands and vegetation at the Category 1 Stockpile footprint area] would be required to be mitigated regardless of future backfilling or not. Response: The Co-Lead Agencies are confusing benefit to the company with benefit to the environment. There is still an environmental benefit to reclaiming wetlands at the site, even if the company cannot claim mitigation credits for it. There is value to wetland restoration within the same watershed, which PolyMet only partially proposes, and on-site mitigation. Additionally, as the FEIS noted, such wetland reclamation credits may be used for contingency mitigation,79 perhaps for the significant indirect wetland impacts this project is likely to have. These wetlands would offer a financial advantage to PolyMet, allowing it to save the cost of restoration for contingency mitigation elsewhere or, if PolyMet does not need the credits, it could establish a wetland bank and sell the credits to other entities, perhaps other mining companies that need wetland credits within the St. Louis River watershed.80● [T]he costs associated with backfilling, additional water treatment rates, and encumbrance compensation determined in revised lease agreements may affect the ability of PolyMet to secure financing. Response: As noted by the Conservation Organizations in 2014, this is an assertion by PolyMet offered without any support whatsoever. It is speculative and the agencies are abdicating their duty to independently verify statements by the company.82 Moreover, it gives a project proposer extraordinary and unjustified control over the alternatives analyzed if an alternative is dismissed based on an unsupported statement by the company that an alternative “may affect the ability” of the company to secure financing. The Conservation Organizations are only asking at this stage that the West Pit Backfill be given consideration as an alternative in the FEIS, not that it necessarily be adopted. The approach taken to this alternative is to speculate on its comparative benefits and drawbacks without any real information, rather than gathering the information first and then making the comparison. The Co-lead Agencies reject this alternative prior to obtaining the very information that they purport to be using to judge it.",ALT,S,O,8,MDNR et al. 2013b
Erin Mittag,"The Co-Lead Agencies have improperly eliminated dry stacking or paste tailings as an alternative to using the pre-existing LTV tailings basin. Under NEPA, the FEIS must: examine all reasonable alternatives to the proposal. In determining the scope of alternatives to be considered, the emphasis is on what is “reasonable” rather than on whether the proponent or applicant likes or is itself capable of carrying out a particular alternative. Reasonable alternatives include those that are practical or feasible from the technical and economic standpoint and using common sense, rather than simply desirable from the standpoint of the applicant.83 Although PolyMet wishes to use the old LTV tailings basin because it is located on the site that they have agreed to purchase, alternative methods of storing waste are technically feasible, environmentally preferable, and avoid what is possibly the most devastating impact that could occur at a mine site—the collapse of a tailings basin, resulting in widespread impacts that could travel and diffuse for tens or even hundreds of miles when waste spills into moving water. We have attached a letter from Dr. David Chambers of the Center for Science in Public Participation. Dr. Chambers has extensive knowledge of both the tailings dam collapse at the Mount Polley mine in British Columbia in 2014 as well as PolyMet’s tailings dam design. In his report, Dr. Chambers observes that there is no engineering reason for tailings dams to fail at the rate that they do, and that this is a “prime indicator that something is wrong with the way tailings dams are designed, constructed, and/or operated.”84 Dr. Chambers also notes that the tailings basin construction method used at the PolyMet site is the least safe construction method, and that PolyMet will continue to use this method. “Extending a risky design on top of an old design that itself poses higher risk, against the recommendation of the Mt. Polley Expert Panel for dry closure, for a facility that has not yet received regulatory approval, would not be recognizing the long-term risks being posed to the public.”85 Dr. Chambers also recommended that the Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility should be constructed using dry stack methods.86 Dr. Chambers’ review was submitted to the Co-Lead Agencies on April 30, 2015, after the release of the report of an independent expert panel that investigated the cause of the Mt. Polley disaster. Although this was after the close of the comment period for the SDEIS, it was submitted well in advance of the FEIS in hopes that the Co-Lead Agencies would recognize the value of the Mt. Polley recommendations and the inherent risks in PolyMet’s use of an old tailings dam designed to store tailings in a way that is no longer considered safe. The Co-Lead Agencies, in response to Dr. Chambers’ work, provided only a single paragraph. They concluded that dry stack tailings did not offer a significant environmental benefit as an alternative. The analysis is dismissive, failing to provide support or analysis consistent with NEPA’s requirements.87 The three reasons given are addressed below:",PD,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"Industry standard for dry stacking includes the use of a basin liner. Construction of a basin liner on the existing LTVSMC tailings basin has been evaluated and determined not to be feasible. Response: As observed by Dr. Chambers, the reason that a basin liner is not feasible is because the tailings basin is not a stable structure, which should bear more heavily on the Co-Lead Agencies’ decision.88 Moreover, this comment ignores the fact that a dry-stacking facility could be built somewhere other than the existing LTVSMC tailings basin. ● Use of dry stack technology would require a new tailings basin to be constructed in a different location as a lined dry stack basin. A separate dry stack tailings basin would increase footprint effects of the project. Response: The impacts of this could potentially be minimal. Unlike an open-pit mine, where some impacts on wetlands, streams and other natural features may be unavoidable due to the precise location of a mineral deposit, a dry-stack tailings facility has more flexibility when it is sited. The Co-Lead Agencies must investigate potential sites for a dry-stack facility that could minimize impacts. It may even be possible to site it elsewhere on the LTVSMC property in an area that is already mining-impacted.",ALT,S,N,11,"No analysis is provided here or in Chambers appendix which supports the opinion that the Tailings Basin would not be stable. The FEIS evaluated a range of alternatives including paste tailings disposal at on an off site brownfield as well as dry stack tailings on site. See Underground Mining Alternative Assessment (Appendix B of FEIS). SDEIS Theme ALT 10, ALT 01. The FEIS has met its requirements under NEPA."
Erin Mittag,"The proposed Project addresses legacy water quality issues of the LTVSMC tailings basin while making use of the brownfield site for tailings disposal. A separate dry stack tailings basin would not address LTVSMC tailings basin legacy issues. Response: PolyMet would still take possession and legal responsibility for permitting at the LTVSMC site. Discharges from the tailings basin would be required to meet state water quality standards and other state and federal environmental laws regardless of whether PolyMet uses it as a disposal site in any event. (See also Section 6 of these comments on the no-action alternative, addressing Cliffs Erie’s legal responsibilities to ensure that this site meets state and federal law).",WAT,S,N,8,No evidence is provided and the Co-lead Agencies have no evidence that PolyMet would take possession of the LTVSMC Tailings Basin if it were not used for their Proposed Project. Use of the LTVSMC Tailings Basin is an efficient means to achieve positive environmental outcomes that have not been achievable to date.
Erin Mittag,"As with the West Pit backfill alternative, the Co-lead Agencies have inappropriately prejudged this alternative, making assumptions about the benefits and drawbacks that are the very things that an alternatives analysis is designed to reveal.",ALT,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"Finally, the current design for the tailings basin does not meet the requirements of Minnesota Rule 6132.2200. Dry-stacking is an alternative made reasonable by virtue of the fact that it is the only way that this mine can comply with Minnesota law. This rule states: B. A reactive mine waste storage facility must be designed by professional engineers registered in Minnesota proficient in the design, construction, operation, and reclamation of facilities for the storage of reactive mine waste, to either: (1) modify the physical or chemical characteristics of the mine waste, or store it in an environment, such that the waste is no longer reactive; or (2) during construction to the extent practicable, and at closure, permanently prevent substantially all water from moving through or over the mine waste and provide for the collection and disposal of any remaining residual waters that drain from the mine waste in compliance with federal and state standards. Mine waste includes tailings.89 “Reactive mine waste” is defined as waste “that is shown through characterization studies to release substances that adversely impact natural resources.”90 In other words, “reactive waste” is not limited to waste that creates acidic conditions. Heavy metals can leach from rock under many conditions, some of which do not involve a low pH; whenever those conditions result in a great enough release of metals to adversely affect natural resources, the rock is deemed “reactive.” Thus the PolyMet tailings will be “reactive” even if they do not result in acid drainage, because they have been characterized (by PolyMet’s modeling) to release (at a minimum) copper, nickel, lead, and arsenic at levels far above surface and/or groundwater quality standards.91 Rule 6132.2200(2)(B) provides two possible means of handling reactive mine waste after closure. Either the waste rock, tailings, and exposed rock must be left in such a way that they are not “reactive” (i.e., they no longer leach heavy metals), or the facilities must be closed in a way that “permanently prevent[s] substantially all water from moving through or over” them. Taken together, the import of the regulations is that nonferrous mine waste and mine pits must be closed in a way that does not result in a significant amount of water that will have to be treated before it can be discharged to the environment. The Statement of Need and Reasonableness for this rule makes it clear that the point of Rule 6132.2200(2)(B) was to preclude perpetual or long term water treatment as a closure option: [M]erely collecting contact water and treating it in order to meet water quality discharge standards, without a substantial effort to minimize the amount of water contacting the waste, has been rejected. While this method may provide acceptable results during active operations, when the permittee is present, the potential for long-term failure of such a system, when the operator is no longer available to correct the situation, is too great. Because of the necessity to provide a permanent solution to the water quality concerns related to reactive mine wastes, the two required methods of storing these wastes are the only reasonable methods currently available.92 The current plan for the tailings basin allows the tailings to remain reactive and allows a significant amount of water to move through the tailings. It thus does not meet the regulatory requirements. The Co-lead agencies should assess the dry stack alternative as the only suggested alternative that might meet the requirements of state law.",PER,S,N,11,
Erin Mittag,"The EIS must provide information on what can be expected under the “no action” alternative in such a way that it can be compared to the impacts of the proposed mine. The FEIS does not adequately assess the “no action” alternative. This issue is presented at MCEA 40 and CBD 107–108, which along with cited exhibits and references are incorporated herein. An EIS must include “no action” as one of its alternatives.93 “No action” in situations like the proposed NorthMet mine and land exchange could mean either that the mine would not be permitted or implemented, or that the land exchange would not occur.94 Importantly, when the choice of no action by the lead agencies would result in “predictable actions by others,” this consequence of the no action alternative needs to be considered and included as part of the no action analysis in the FEIS.95 Although the NorthMet FEIS purports to do this, it does not provide adequate information about the environmental conditions that would be expected under the No Action Alternative. This violates 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(b), which requires the FEIS to “devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail including the proposed action so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits.” The FEIS does not contain sufficient detail on the predicted water quality at the Plant Site and in the Embarrass River watershed under the No Action Alternative to allow an evaluation of the comparative merits of the Proposed Action. In fact, the FEIS completely fails to provide any information on the expected water quality at the Plant Site and in the Embarrass River watershed under the No Action Alternative. Instead, the predicted water quality under the Proposed Action is exhaustively compared to a modeled “Continuation of Existing Conditions” (CEC) scenario, which ignores the existing responsible party (Cliffs Erie)’s legal obligation to clean up and manage the site consistent with state and federal environmental laws. In addition to the violation of 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(b), this violates the requirement that the FEIS provide a “hard look” at the impacts of the Proposed Action. By repeatedly comparing the polluting effect of the Proposed Action with an already polluted situation that is presumed to continue (but which in reality would not and could not continue under existing law), the FEIS presents an inaccurate assessment of the impacts of the Proposed Action. Furthermore, the “Existing Conditions” that were modeled by PolyMet and disclosed in the FEIS do not actually reflect currently existing conditions, because Cliffs Erie has already taken steps to address water quality issues at the site as required by a consent decree with MPCA. Cliffs Erie and MPCA entered into a judicially enforceable consent decree in March 2010, with Cliffs Erie agreeing to take corrective actions to resolve “all alleged violations” of its NPDES permits at these locations.96 Pursuant to the consent decree, Cliffs Erie was required to submit “Short-Term Mitigation Evaluation Plans” for each of the three locations.97 Cliffs Erie was also required to submit “detailed Field Studies Plan Outlines” for each location.98 And, “Long-Term Plans” were required to identify mitigation strategies to address elevated concentrations of sulfates and other parameters of concern at each location.99 Each of these corrective actions were required to be approved by MPCA, and would then become “an integral and enforceable part” of the consent decree.100 If Cliffs Erie fails to comply with the consent decree, it is required to pay monetary penalties to MPCA.101 In addition to failing to adequately address and disclose the corrective actions that have already been taken by Cliffs Erie at the LTV sites in its analysis and disclosure of “existing conditions,” the FEIS also fails to assess the additional corrective measures that will continue to be undertaken by Cliffs Erie in the event the no action alternative is chosen. The very purpose of the consent decree is to bring Cliffs Erie into compliance with the NPDES permit requirements at the LTV tailings basin and mine site, along with the Dunka Pit. Cliffs Erie coming into compliance with the Clean Water Act is not only “predictable” and “reasonably foreseeable,” but also legally required under both the consent decree and the Clean Water Act. Thus comparing in the FEIS the proposed action with a no action alternative where pollution would continue indefinitely at the plant site is both inaccurate and unlawful under NEPA.",ALT,S,N,8,The CEC provides a reasonable means of determining the relative efficacy of impact avoidance and/or minimization measures incorporated into the project if they were not present. Final EIS Section 5.2.2.4 provides a qualitative description of water-related resources under the No Action Alternative. See FEIS pg. 5-93.
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS also fails to describe the foreseeable impacts of the no action alternative at the mine site. According to the Draft Record Of Decision (DROD): the reason the Forest Service is conducting this land exchange is that if it does not, PolyMet is likely to litigate its right to build an open pit mine on Forest Service property acquired under the Weeks Act, and the outcome of that suit is uncertain. In other words, the Forest Service believes that there is a significant chance that the no action alternative would result in an open pit mine on Forest Service land. Although we agree that this outcome is not certain, if it is foreseeable enough that the Forest Service is trading away a ten-square-mile contiguous piece of property with irreplaceable resources in order to avoid it, it is surely certain enough to assess in the FEIS. Indeed, the Forest Service’s actions to avoid this scenario prove that it is already effectively foreseen. The Forest Service has the established right to impose conditions on mining operations to protect natural resources in situations like this one, where the Forest Service owns the surface and a private party owns the mineral estate.102 Because the mine as proposed would violate so many of the provisions of the Superior National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan), the Forest Service would undoubtedly impose many additional requirements if the mine were to be built on Forest Service land. The Forest Service cannot assume for the purposes of NEPA that an open pit mine on Forest Service land would have the same impacts as an open pit mine on non-Forest Service land. We understand that the Forest Service does not want this mine on its property, and we can hardly blame it. We also understand that the Forest Service sees an advantage in obtaining other land in exchange. But neither we nor the Forest Service know that this is the environmentally preferable outcome, and the FEIS does nothing to enlighten us. The whole point to the NEPA process is to look at the actual expected environmental effects of the range of alternatives in a given situation. In this particular situation, it is unclear that there will be any on-the-ground environmental benefit of Forest Service ownership of the nonfederal lands, as opposed to the current owner. Will water quality, vegetation, wildlife, or ecosystem services benefit from the change of ownership? FEIS that goes into this alternative at length. On the other hand, would these natural resources benefit from Forest Service ownership of the mine site, if a mine will be built regardless? The FEIS tells us absolutely nothing about this possibility. The Forest Service is hiding behind its legal position when it says that if there is no land exchange, there will be no mine. But the Forest Service cannot have it both ways. If an open pit mine on the Superior National Forest is foreseeable enough to drive this entire action, it is foreseeable enough to require assessment under NEPA.",ROD,S,N,12,"FEIS 3.3.3.3.7, Any USFS authorization of private open pit mining in the Superior National Forest would need to be consistent with the management objectives of the Superior National Forest. The USFS does not believe that such authority or consistency exists with respect to the open pit mining proposal of PolyMet. The Land Exchange is a solution to a legal conflict, not an indicator of foreseeable outcomes through a settlement or court decision. It is therefore speculative to predict environmental impacts under the proposed scenario."
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS fails to provide adequate analysis of the effectiveness of mitigation measures, and the impacts of reasonably foreseeable accidents and failures. Where the FEIS relies on mitigation measures as its reason for not disclosing impacts should those mitigation measures fail, it must include a discussion of the efficacy and certainty of the mitigation measures. That discussion must include whether the measures are proven or theoretical and the degree to which they have worked as planned at other facilities. The agencies must also assess the probability of accidents, and make a holistic assessment of accident risk for all mining features.",NEPA,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"PolyMet relies on a number of engineered systems to minimize impacts on the environment from the proposed mine. This is no different than what is done for every modern industrial mine around the world indeed it is legally required in virtually any jurisdiction. Each mine plan is designed to address the particular difficulties of the site, the ore body, and the mining and processing methods. The FEIS presents the NorthMet mine plan as though it identifies the perfect engineered systems that will result in a mine with no accidents, no failures, and no errors in the systems as designed, installed, or maintained. Mining companies throughout history have laid out plans to minimize environmental impacts. And yet significant environmental impacts often occur, as demonstrated in recent global mining catastrophes highlighted in the media. Given the size of the proposed mine and its location in one of the wettest parts of the United States, concern for accidents, failures, and unforeseen design, installation, and maintenance errors should be heightened rather than dismissed. NEPA requires that to the extent that errors, accidents, and failures are reasonably foreseeable over the expected life of the project (i.e., more than five hundred years), the potential impacts must be disclosed in the FEIS. The FEIS completely fails to meet this requirement. This shortcoming affects virtually every aspect of the mine plan and the FEIS. It was raised generally and in relation to several specific mine features in our comments on the SDEIS at MCEA 3, 5–6, 22, 40–54 Friends 1–8, 32–37, 39– 40 CBD 33–45, 57–59 and in our supplemental letter on the Mt. Polley tailings basin disaster in British Columbia. All of these materials along with exhibits cited therein are incorporated herein. The legal requirement begins with the most elementary aspect of NEPA review an EIS must disclose all reasonably foreseeable significant impacts of a proposed project. Both the CEQ and the courts recognize that this involves some conjecture in many situations, whether or not a particular impact will occur cannot be known with any certainty at the time an EIS is prepared. But this does not allow an agency to ignore the possibility of impacts. In the face of uncertainty, an agency must provide a scientifically defensible assessment of the likelihood of the impact’s occurrence, and a discussion of the potential effects commensurate with the likelihood and severity of those effects.105 In a situation where errors, accidents, and failures could result in significant impacts, “[t]hat circumstance obliges the agency to undertake risk assessment an estimate of both the consequences that might occur and the probability of their occurrence.” While “NEPA does not require consideration of risks that are ‘merely speculative’ or ‘infinitesimal,’” it also does not allow an agency to ignore risks based on unsupported assumptions that errors, accidents, and failures will not occur. To use waste storage facilities as an example, the FEIS Response to Comments Theme GT 15 acknowledges that “If incorrectly designed, constructed or managed, or from other unforeseen circumstances, waste material storage facilities would have the potential to result in increased hydrologic and/or water quality effects and could potentially lead to slope or dam failure.” Pursuant to NEPA, this acknowledged fact necessitates a risk assessment addressing “an estimate of both the consequences that might occur and the probability of their occurrence.” In the NorthMet FEIS, however “hypothetical failure scenarios are not assessed,” apparently because the Co-Lead Agencies believe that “design and safety requirements, including adaptive management procedures” will work perfectly for hundreds of years.109 Theme WR 129 makes the statement “With appropriate monitoring and pre-planned contingency actions, and adequate financial assurance, it is technically feasible to maintain the operation of engineered systems indefinitely into the future.” Unfortunately, technical feasibility has never been enough to prevent accidents and failures. And history is replete with engineered systems that theoretically should have worked perfectly, but nonetheless eventually revealed that the engineers who designed them or the workers who built and maintained them were not themselves infallible, not to mention myriad external forces beyond human control. Human Error It is often noted that while the safety and reliability of engineered systems in-and-of-themselves continues to improve over time, the propensity for human error does not. Across numerous industries, the percentage of errors caused by human error is estimated at about 80 percent. Thus despite the technological advances that have been made in aviation, maritime shipping, medicine, IT, and many other industries, accident and failure rates decrease far more slowly than would be expected given improvements in technology. In a study of “operation events” that represented some sort of operations failure at nuclear power plants, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission made the following observations 1. Human error contributed significantly to risk in nearly all events analyzed. Forty-one percent of events involved partial or complete loss of either onsite or offsite power, 22 percent involved loss of Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) and 19 percent involved loss of feedwater. . . . The average human error contribution to the change in risk was 62 percent. 2. Latent errors were present in every event analyzed and were more predominant than active errors by a ratio of 4 to 1. Latent errors were noted in all facets of performance studied, including operations, design and design change work practices, maintenance practices and maintenance work controls, procedures and procedure development, corrective action program, and management supervision. . . . 3. Without exception, the operating events analyzed included multiple contributing factors. On the average, the thirty-seven events contained four or more human errors in combination with hardware failures. Fifty percent of events contained five or more errors. Many events contained between six and eight human errors. 4. Human errors can result in the failure or increased likelihood of failure of risk-significant equipment. For a sample of ten events with the highest event importance, human error was determined to contribute to component failure. There were three events where a single human error contributed to a single PRA [Probabilistic Risk Assessment] basic event, and seven events where multiple human errors contributed to multiple PRA basic events. . . . 5. Design and design change work practice errors were present in 81 percent of events, maintenance practices and maintenance work control errors were present in 76 percent of events, and operations errors were present in 54 percent of events. Additionally, more maintenance and operations errors mapped to basic events in the PRA model than did design and design change errors. 6. Forty-one percent of the analyzed events demonstrated evidence of failure to",NEPA,S,N,8,Geotechnical evaluations have been completed at the NorthMet site which indicate designs meet factors of safety which is a measurement of risk. No evidence has been provided proving this analysis is flawed. Recent mining accidents are not evidence that the NorthMet project is unsafe or that a dam failure at the NorthMet tailings basin is foreseeable.
Erin Mittag,"Effectiveness of mitigation measures. In addition to the potential for errors, accidents, and failures, an important factor in assessing the risk of unexpected consequences is the uncertainty of mitigation measures designed to prevent those consequences. To use the tailings basin seepage containment system as an example, a risk assessment must account for the extent to which the actual performance of the system in the field remains an unknown. As discussed below, the record contains no examples of similar systems achieving the level of capture assumed by the FEIS. While the design may work perfectly in a software model, conditions and events in the real world rarely conform to theoretical designs. Established mitigation measures have a history that can be used to estimate the uncertainty and risk that outcomes will not match the theoretical or modeled expectations. The fact that success rates for a mitigation measure are not available does not provide a reason to assume that it will work perfectly. To the contrary, it increases the uncertainty that the measure will perform as designed. The FEIS must disclose and discuss the unknowns of the systems and mitigation measures proposed for this project, and what that uncertainty means in terms of risks to the environment.",ALT,S,N,8,"Performance in the field is not an unknown. A purpose of engineering is to create with an acceptable degree of certainty the performance of man-made systems before they are built. With respect to capture systems, the FEIS analysis does not assume perfection as the comment states. The FEIS assessment of water quality impact probabilities is an important indicator of risk."
Erin Mittag,"NEPA requires that an EIS include a discussion of “means to mitigate adverse environmental impacts. ""The NorthMet FEIS is replete with mitigation measures; however it does not address the uncertainty of their effectiveness or the risk that they will not operate as intended. Rather, it assumes that all mitigation measures work perfectly, for hundreds of years if not forever. This is not the approach to mitigation measures required by NEPA: [NEPA] does require that an EIS discuss mitigation measures, with “sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated.” Methow Valley, 490 U.S. at 352, 109 S.Ct. 1835. An essential component of a reasonably complete mitigation discussion is an assessment of whether the proposed mitigation measures can be effective. Compare Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain v. U.S. Forest Service, 137 F.3d 1372, 1381 (9th Cir.1998) (disapproving an EIS that lacked such an assessment) with Okanogan Highlands Alliance v. Williams, 236 F.3d 468, 477 (9th Cir.2000) (upholding an EIS where “[e]ach mitigating process was evaluated separately and given an effectiveness rating”). The Supreme Court has required a mitigation discussion precisely for the purpose of evaluating whether anticipated environmental impacts can be avoided. Methow Valley, 490 U.S. at 351– 52, 109 S.Ct. 1835(citing 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(ii)). A mitigation discussion without at least some evaluation of effectiveness is useless in making that determination. Furthermore, the “evaluation of effectiveness” must be supported by substantive evidence: [T]he Court holds that the Corps’ reliance on mitigation measures that were unsupported by any evidence in the record cannot be given deference under NEPA. The Court remands to the Corps for further findings on cumulative impacts, impacts to ranchlands, and the efficacy of mitigation measures. Several examples are provided below for which the FEIS fails to provide information about the uncertainty of the effectiveness of particular engineered systems or mitigation measures. Rather than preparing a risk assessment to account for uncertainty and potential errors, accidents, and failures, the FEIS repeatedly invokes the phrase “adaptive management.” Whatever might go wrong with the project, all will be corrected by adaptive management. This approach also runs afoul of NEPA, because it postpones the disclosure of environmental impacts until after a project has been undertaken. Most of the promises of adaptive management in the FEIS amount to nothing more than the promise to make changes after problems occur. While of course a company must make changes if problems occur, this cannot substitute for revealing the potential for problems before the project is permitted. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit puts it, “The agency cannot increase the risk of harm to the environment and then perform its studies. . . . This approach has the process exactly backwards.” In adopting 40 C.F.R. 1502.22(b), which addresses how to proceed in the face of uncertainty, the CEQ stated: It must be remembered that the basic thrust of an agency’s responsibilities under NEPA is to predict the environmental effects of proposed action before the action is taken and make those effects known. Reasonable forecasting and speculation is thus implicit in NEPA, and we must reject any attempt by agencies to shirk their responsibilities under NEPA by labeling any and all discussion of future environmental effects as “crystal ball inquiry.” Furthermore, adaptive management plans are themselves subject to the same risks and uncertainty that pertain to engineered systems as initially planned. The FEIS mentions a number of possible “fixes” for problems that may arise, but once again fails to discuss the uncertainty as to whether they will actually be effective. The FEIS simply assumes that all problems can be fixed. As the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin put it in addressing unplanned, unpredicted water quality violations at the Flambeau Mine in Wisconsin: the mining company could not be expected to end its discharges, because to do so would require it to “stop the rain.” If the history of mining and hazardous waste sites has taught us anything, it is the unfortunate reality that not all unforeseen results can be fixed to the point of meeting environmental standards. Although the FEIS relies on promises of “adaptive management” to evade an assessment of risks to natural resources, it does not provide adequate adaptive management plans to cover most of these risks. These statements amount to little more than promises to fix any problems that occur. The FEIS provides no basis for the assumption that impacts can and will be limited to the impacts discussed in the FEIS. The reference documents include several adaptive management plans for different systems, which are reviewed in comments from the Center for Science in Public Participation (CSP2).126 As CSP2 points out, PolyMet’s proposed use of Adaptive Management is problematic because most of its applications do not include important features of adaptive management. Most of the proposed Adaptive Management Plans are in fact more akin to normal project management where project activities and plans are modified as necessary and appropriate based on changed conditions, failed activities, leaks, improvements in available technologies, etc. CSP2’s comments on adaptive management plans are incorporated herein by reference. There are essentially two categories of Adaptive Management measures discussed in the FEIS. The first are systems that are designed with some flexibility involved and with some planning of the steps to be taken if certain contingencies occur. The FEIS refers to these systems as “adaptive,” while other systems are referred to as “fixed.” The adaptive systems are the Waste Water Treatment Plant and Facility, the Category I Stockpile cover, the HRF cover, and the Tailings Basin pond liner. All other systems are considered “fixed,” including the containment and collection systems and the HRF liner. The FEIS does not provide true adaptive management plans for any of the fixed systems, and no arrangement is planned to ensure that they can be paid for if needed. In regards to these systems, CSP2 notes: “It is not sufficient to just monitor activities and commit to possibly implementing from a list of contingencies when a problem is discovered. This is not adaptive management - it is the mine operator responding to a problem without clear commitment to meaningful adaptive process or outcome.” The FEIS includes a section entitled “Contingency Mitigation” starting on page 5-239. These are measures that are “not initially included in financial assurance,” and hence it is completely unclear how they will be paid for, particularly if the condition does not arise or is not discovered until after the mine closes and PolyMet no longer has a source of revenue. The list of potential problems includes: · Overflow of process water sumps or ponds;· Water quality problems in streams due to rail transport; · Groundwater quality noncompliance due to liner issues;· West Pit water not as expected; · Greater inflow to pits than expected; · New surface seepage locations below the Tailings Basin; · Tailings Basin water not as expected; · Water quality downstream from Tailings Basin not as expected; · Northward flow of pit water. For each of these potential problems, the FEIS suggests mitigation measures that could be used to address the problems if they arise. These suggestions do not come close to constituting an adaptive management plan, and this particular section of the FEIS does not refer to them as such. But throughout the FEIS and especially in the Response to Comments, these suggestions are elevated to the status of “adaptive management,” making it appear that PolyMet and the Co-lead Agencies have a plan to address problems that arise, when that is simply not true. In general, wherever a question is raised regarding the certainty of the mine plan and the engineered systems’ ability to meet regulatory requirements and otherwise protect the environment, the response is that no assessment is needed, because “adaptive management” will be used to fix the problem. For example, Comment Theme GT 15 states, “The SDEIS does not properly address the potential environmental consequences of a geotechnical failure due to unplanned and catastrophic events (e.g. extreme weather events, equipment failure, human error) at the Tailings Basin, Hydrometallurgical Residue facility, stockpiles, or pit.” The response is, “Because the risk of failure is mitigated through application of design and safety requirements, including adaptive management procedures, the potential effects of hypothetical failure scenarios are not assessed in the FEIS.”128 But there is no adaptive management plan that addresses problems that arise due to extreme weather events, equipment failure, and human error. FEIS App. A. As another example, Theme AQ 05 asks about “sulfates and toxic metals . . . that are not captured for treatment.” The response: “The NorthMet Project Proposed Action is designed to capture sulfates and metals with engineering controls and adaptive management.” But there is no adaptive management plan (and no money will be set aside) to address solutes that leach to groundwater. Although the list cited above does mention some potential ways that the problem could be addressed, the FEIS does not review the efficacy of those methods and how they would be paid for. Regardless of whether the suggestions",NEPA,S,O,8,"The FEIS discloses potential impacts from modeling mitigation such as imperfect covers, liners, capture systems, and treatment systems, for example. The Adaptive Water Management Plan (AWMP) in concert with other documentation is an adequate disclosure of mitigation (PolyMet 2015d). The AWMP and FEIS state that its purpose of this approach is to ensure compliance by making predictions and taking corrective actions. PolyMet 2015d Section 1.1. FEIS pg. 5-234."
Erin Mittag,"Issues in relation to specific engineered systems are discussed below, including: errors, accidents, and failures; the uncertainty of mitigation measures; and unfounded promises of adaptive management. However, two other factors affect uncertainty and risk for all systems at the proposed NorthMet project: cost and financial assurance; and the length of time that systems will need to operate. In regard to cost and financial assurance, many problems that could occur would not surface until after mining ends and the company no longer has a source of revenue. As an example, the tailings basin leachate containment and collection system will likely need to operate for centuries after mining has ended. A series of mishaps, errors, and negligence might result in a blocked drain, a build-up of water, and a significant rupture in the containment wall. Fixing the system would no doubt be expensive. PolyMet will not be required to post financial assurance at the outset to cover this or other unplanned events, because Minnesota regulations only require financial assurance for predicted reclamation needs. If things do not go according to prediction to the extent that a permit violation may result, the DNR may require financial assurance at the time when the potential violation is discovered. In this example, because the problem would not occur until after mining has ceased, there would be no source of financing. Whether it is called “mitigation” or “adaptive management,” it is not effective if there is no way to pay for it.",FIN,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes FIN 05, FIN 06. Violation of the Permit to Mine may or may not equate to an violation of water quality or air quality permits. Financial assurance generally considers a wide variety of contingencies as well as on-going site maintenance."
Erin Mittag,"Furthermore, even before mining ceases, there is no guarantee that the mining company will have the money for additional financial assurance to cover contingencies as they arise. In fact, a typical scenario at a mine that becomes a Superfund site is that the mine begins with financial assurance set aside to cover reclamation costs, just as is planned for PolyMet. A problem occurs, which in this case could be anything on the list above, or many other possibilities that have not yet been recognized. Environmental standards are violated, and the regulatory agency seeks money from the mining company to address it. Often it is precisely this cost that drives the mining company into bankruptcy. In regard to the length of time over which systems may need to be maintained and/or operated, a number of risks become foreseeable that would not be an issue for a project that would be maintenance-free within a reasonable time following the cessation of mineral extraction. For example, over a 500-year period the risk of societal change resulting in a disruption in regulatory oversight or the failure of financial institutions becomes foreseeable, where it would not be considered foreseeable over a 50-year period. The FEIS does not discuss the fact that governments and other institutions do not last as long as may be necessary to ensure the continued maintenance and/or operation of systems at the NorthMet site. However, the same issue has been thoroughly vetted in the context of storage and disposal of nuclear waste, where governments and experts have uniformly reached the conclusion that long-term storage requiring active maintenance is ultimately not an appropriate option. Quoting from the International Atomic Energy Agency: All human made facilities require maintenance to preserve their integrity. It follows that if the integrity of a structure is essential to protecting the health and safety of people and the environment, ongoing maintenance will be required to avoid gradual deterioration of the protection afforded by the facility. Ongoing maintenance requires the continued existence of authorities and institutions that can ensure that essential maintenance is carried out. . . . . . Since adequate protection of humans and the environment will continue only as long as maintenance is continued on storage facilities, and since some of the radioactive material in storage will remain hazardous for many thousands of years, maintenance — or institutional control — would be required for such periods of time or until permanent disposal is implemented. A review of world history reveals that turmoil and change usually occur in much shorter periods of time and therefore that it is unlikely that any societal infrastructure currently in place or envisaged would last for the time period needed.138 And: The safety of long term storage requires the maintenance of the industrial, regulatory and security infrastructure as described in previous sections. Long term safety also requires that future societies will be in a position to exercise active control over these materials and maintain effective transfer of responsibility, knowledge and information from generation to generation. Long term storage is only sustainable if future societies can maintain these responsibilities. Active controls cannot be guaranteed in perpetuity because there is no guarantee that the necessary societal infrastructure can be maintained in perpetuity. Therefore, for the types of radioactive wastes considered here—wastes that remain hazardous for thousands of years—perpetual storage is not considered to be either feasible or acceptable.139 As consistently acknowledged by nuclear regulatory agencies, “turmoil and change” in human institutions is foreseeable over the time frames for which maintenance activities may be required at the NorthMet site. The risks to the environment from such turmoil and change therefore must be disclosed in the FEIS. Aside from the issue of the longevity of human institutions, activities stretching over hundreds of years also present a much greater risk to the environment due simply to probabilities over time. For example, if the probability of a wastewater treatment plant malfunction and resulting release of polluted water to the environment is 1 per 50 years and wastewater treatment was planned to operate for 25 years, there would be a 50 percent probability of such an event during the lifetime of the project. On the other hand, if wastewater treatment is planned for a 500-year period, 10 such events could be expected. The probability of a major failure resulting in severe impacts would also be correspondingly higher. Such information is absolutely critical to a determination as to whether the benefits of a project are worth the impacts and risks. If, for example, a tailings basin dam must hold for more than 500 years, and the probability of a catastrophic breach over that time approaches even 5 percent, one would hope that the Co- Lead Agencies care enough for future generations not to leave them with that risk. As one court put it: “Any substantial risk that the dam could fail would be intolerable; and, if the agency were to proceed in the face of that risk, that would constitute an abuse of agency discretion.”140 And from the Independent Panel on the Mt. Polley dam breach: In risk-based dam safety practice for conventional water dams, some particular level of tolerable risk is often specified that, in turn, implies some tolerable failure rate. The Panel does not accept the concept of a tolerable failure rate for tailings dams. To do so, no matter how small, would institutionalize failure. First Nations will not accept this, the public will not permit it, government will not allow it, and the mining industry will not survive it.141 Disclosing the statistical probability of failure",NEPA,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes FIN 05, FIN 06. Probabilistic modeling, sensitivity analyses, consideration of climate change,"
Erin Mittag,"The collapse or major breach of the tailings dam is likely the most devastating impact that could occur at the PolyMet mine. Recent reports demonstrate that the risk of tailings dam collapse is not nearly as remote as PolyMet suggests. Two hundred and fourteen tailings dams have had failures or accidents since 1940.142 Since 1960, “serious” and “very serious” tailings dam failures have occurred with greater frequency.143 Very large releases occur even at relatively small mines, such as the Mt. Polley mine.144 Moreover, the cost of cleanup for a catastrophic failure averages $543 million.145 This dollar value is beyond the capacity of most mining companies to cover. Nor is it required that the risk of tailings dam collapse be included in the financial assurance package.146 While the cited Bowker and Chambers report is not about any particular mine, the authors note how critical statistical analysis of tailings dam failures is when evaluating the potential for a collapse at any given mine: Having something more like “actuarial data” to refer to is important in understanding the potential magnitude of loss from an individual dam or a permitting districts portfolio of dams and TSFs [Tailings Storage Facilities]. With such low frequency high severity losses we can never assign risk to an individual TSF based on its design and receiving environment parameters. Unless it has an identified flaw that puts it at near certain risk of imminent failure, we can’t say whether a given dam “will” fail. We can only say what the consequence would be in economic terms if it failed.147 In addition, Dr. Chambers has identified risks unique to the PolyMet Proposed Alternative tailings basin, including a choice to use the cheapest and least safe form of dam construction, and, most importantly, the choice to use wet, instead of dry, tailings storage. Dry tailings storage would eliminate the chance of tailings dam collapse, a benefit that outweighs any downsides due to the potential catastrophic impact of such a collapse.",GT,S,O,8,The FEIS quantitatively evaluated the safety of the proposed Tailings Basin (PolyMet 2015l). The proposed dam construction methods are not unique. See the Flotation Tailings Basin Management Plan version 5 (March 2015): Attachment H - Flotation Tailings Basin Dam Break Analysis.
Erin Mittag,"As noted in the Friends of the Boundary Waters comments on the SDEIS and still relevant here, the FEIS does not describe the pipeline system that will be used to transport untreated and treated water and tailings.148 A description of the length of pipeline that will be used, the various purposes, the pipeline construction and the pumping system is a necessary first step in assessing the risk of pipeline spills. In a review of fourteen copper mines (representing 89 percent of copper mined in the United States), the conservation organization Earthworks found that every mine experienced pipeline spills. The number of spills per mine over a 26 year period ranged from 2 to 54. The EPA’s assessment of potential mining in Bristol Bay includes a good example of a risk assessment for pipeline spills.151 The assessment used statistics from the oil and gas industry. The assessment found: Although the range of published annual failure rates for U.S. oil and gas pipelines spans more than one order of magnitude (0.000046 to 0.0011 per km-yr) (URS 2000), the range for pipelines most similar to the assessment pipelines along the transportation corridor is much narrower. For example, the failure rate is 0.0010 failure/km-yr for pipelines less than 20 cm in diameter (OGP 2010), 0.0015 failure/km-yr for pipelines in a climate similar to Alaska (Alberta, Canada) (ERCB 2013), and 0.00062 failure/km-yr for pipelines run by small operators (those operating total pipeline lengths less than 670 km) (URS 2000). The geometric mean of these three values yields a failure probability of 0.0010 failure/km-yr. This overall estimate of annual failure probability, coupled with the 113-km length of each pipeline as it runs along the transportation corridor within the Kvichak River watershed, results in an 11% probability of a failure in each of the four pipelines each year. Thus, the probability of a pipeline failure occurring over the duration of the Pebble 2.0 scenario (i.e., approximately 25 years) would be 95% for each pipeline. The expected number of failures in each pipeline would be about 2.2, 2.8, and 8.6 over the life of the mine in the Pebble 0.25, 2.0, and 6.5 scenarios, respectively. The chance of a large rupture in each of the three pipelines over the life of the mine would exceed 25%, 30%, and 67% in the Pebble 0.25, 2.0, and 6.5 scenarios, respectively. In each of the three scenarios, there would be a greater than 99.9% chance that at least one of the three pipelines carrying liquid would fail during the project lifetime. The Co-lead Agencies apparently take the position that because engineered systems have progressed, the history of accidents and failures in the past has little bearing on the probability of accidents and failures in the futures. But as the Bristol Bay assessment points out: It may be argued that engineering can reduce pipeline failures rates below historical levels, but improved engineering has little effect on the rate of human errors. Many pipeline failures, such as the cyanide water spill at the Fort Knox mine (Fairbanks, Alaska) that resulted from a bulldozer ripper blade hitting the pipeline (ADEC 2012), are due to human errors. Perhaps more important, human error can negate safety systems. For example, on July 25 and 26, 2010, crude oil spilled into the Kalamazoo River, Michigan, from a pipeline operated by Enbridge Energy. A series of in-line inspections had showed multiple corrosion and crack-like anomalies at the river crossing, but no field inspection was performed (Barrett 2012). When the pipeline failed, more than 3 million L (20,000 barrels) of oil spilled over 2 days as operators repeatedly overrode the shut-down system and restarted the line (Barrett 2012). The spill was finally reported by a local gas company employee who happened to witness the leak. The spill may have been prevented if repairs had been made when defects were detected, and the release could have been minimized if operators had promptly shut down the line.153 The assessment goes on to identify resources that could be affected by pipeline spills, and the range of potential consequences. The risk probabilities calculated for Bristol Bay may not apply to the proposed NorthMet Mine. The lack of information about pipelines in the NorthMet FEIS makes it impossible to draw comparisons or to estimate what the degree of risk might be. However, the Earthworks Report and the Bristol Bay assessment do indicate that the risk of pipeline leaks and ruptures at any mine is not “remote or highly speculative.” The FEIS thus must present information about the degree of risk and the potential consequences.",WAT,S,O,8,"The alignment selected for the Treated Water Pipeline between the Mine Site and Plant site is parallel to Dunka Road and has a total length of approximately 40,000 feet (PolyMet 2015r). The flotation tailings basin pipeline is depicted in Large Figure 6 of the Plant Site Management Plan (PolyMet 2015r). Spills from the flotation tailings basin pipeline would be deposited in the tailings basin."
Erin Mittag,"In the realm of transportation, risks to natural resources arise both from accidents and from inherent imperfections in modes of transport. The two most obvious transportation risks that are inadequately assessed in the FEIS are the risks of accidents and the uncertainty of containing ore dust and spillage along the transportation corridor. While the FEIS includes a probabilistic risk assessment for accidents involving diesel fuel and PAX, the results understate the risk of accidents because of the limitation to these two materials. Furthermore, the assumption that all shipments begin in Duluth very significantly reduces predicted transportation impacts. Finally, the risk of accidents in regards to the shipment of waste and of mineral concentrate has been arbitrarily excluded.157 As the FEIS states that both waste and mineral concentrate will be shipped from the facility, accidents involving these shipments are foreseeable and thus must be addressed in the FEIS. Dust and spilled ore from rail transport has been identified as a risk of the proposed project from the start and remains an issue in the FEIS. As with virtually every other system at the mine, the FEIS provides an optimistic estimate regarding the amount of spillage without regard for accidents, less-than-perfect maintenance, or simple uncertainty. Rather than discussing the probabilities that some rail cars at some times will not achieve the predicted 97 percent reduction in spillage, the FEIS assumes that all will go as planned and recommends monitoring “to check for any potential deteriorations of water quality over time from ore spillage.” The Conservation Organizations agree with the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC): “GLIFWC does not believe that monitoring of the creeks along the rail line will be effective in preventing or minimizing impacts because once detected in monitoring, the impact will have already occurred. GLIFWC states that cleanup of ore dust in an aquatic environment is a long and difficult process. ""Furthermore, monitoring to identify impacts after they occur cannot take the place of disclosure of the risks of impacts in a NEPA document.",O,S,N,6,"FEIS pg. 5-164, 5-251. SDEIS Theme HAZ 06"

Erin Mittag,"While the comments submitted on the SDEIS went into considerable detail on how to remedy the mistakes in analysis and research, it appears from the response to comments that no significant additions were made to the FEIS to correct these many omissions and mistakes. Nor does the FEIS or Response to Comments address most of Dr. Malusis’s suggestions. Failure to respond to his specific comments violates CEQ NEPA regulations. “Final environmental impact statements shall respond to comments . . . . [and agencies] shall discuss at appropriate points in the final statement any responsible opposing view which was not adequately discussed in the draft statement. . .”163 Moreover, where the FEIS did respond to his points it still fell short of assessing uncertainty and risk and disclosing the potential environmental consequences.",NEPA,S,N,5,The Co-lead Agencies have considered all public comments and have responded to them. The Co- lead Agencies are not required to perform analyses and disclose details requested by the public.
Erin Mittag,"As discussed above, much of the FEIS is premised on assumptions that whatever the issue or problem, it will be fixed. This assumption is apparent in the responses to comments on liners and covers. For example, rather than correcting the identified slope gradient issue and properly addressing the missing information on how the Category 1 Stockpile cover would be designed to avoid root and freeze damage, the response merely says that maintenance would continue long-term to deal with erosion and tree removal.164 Similar responses to comments regarding the stockpiles’ covers need for ongoing maintenance are also made without addressing Dr. Malusis’s expressed concerns.165 This assurance does not engage the issue raised by Dr. Malusis, that the cover should be designed with known properties that prevent erosional damage before it occurs. Vague references to maintenance are not sufficient analysis of potential impacts under NEPA. The response goes on to make conclusory statements about how liners will perform as predicted in the overly optimistic SDEIS.166 Dr. Malusis has given an important critique on how the liners likely will not perform to expectations that goes well beyond this cursory mention, and has asked for more information on permeability issues that has not been provided. The Co-lead Agency response is insufficient under applicable law.",WAT,S,O,8,"PolyMet 2014p, PolyMet 2015d Section 3"
Erin Mittag,"Similar to the failure to address Dr. Malusis’s concerns for the Category 1 Stockpile, the response regarding the Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility also avoids addressing important concerns. Rather than providing the information requested, the response merely repeated lab research information.167 This response does not address the need for site- specific testing and fails to provide additional information that is necessary to evaluate potential environmental impacts at this facility.",WAT,S,O,8,PolyMet 2014a of FEIS App A; RS33/RS65
Erin Mittag,"Responses also highlight the fact that the FEIS’s analysis is incomplete. The statement that “Additional geotechnical analysis and design details would be required for permitting, including more detail on the foundation material characteristics, design details to ensure foundation and liner integrity, and details on the installation, operation, monitoring, and maintenance of the liners, covers, and stockpiles”168 admits that the FEIS analysis does not cover significant details that will affect the degree of environmental impact.

Erin Mittag,"Regarding the lack of support for the assumption that liners at the hydrometallurgical facility will actually work as projected, the response to comments merely reiterates the fact that the proponent intends to use a double liner and a leakage recovery system.169 This response is given despite an absence of information in the NEPA documents about the liners and their real-world success rate, or studies showing how they would operate in Northern Minnesota with these specific wastes. Nor does the response to comments address the concerns raised about the agencies’ failure to support the assumption that bentonite will perform as expected, or that freeze-thaw cycles cause erosion and liner breakage. In response to comments that liner leakage rates used were unrealistic, the response merely reiterated that the leakage rate was based on literature values and modeling.170 The very point of the comment was that the leakage rate should be based on more than literature values and modeling; it should include real-world testing and historic data regarding the efficacy of liners at other mines to assess the actual potential for leakage.",GT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes GT 11, GT 12"
Erin Mittag,"The response to the comment that liner leakage is often the product of mistakes in installation is similarly limited to a reiteration that PolyMet plans to use liners, completely failing to respond to the comment.171 Liner installations involve covering uneven ground for distances as long as a mile or more with virtually no breaks or gaps. While theoretically of course this could be done perfectly, it rarely is. This is a good example of a situation where the human factor often intervenes; perfect installation requires commitment, ability, and patience that are sometimes lacking. Across all of these responses is a marked unwillingness to address the need for consideration of both site-specific factors and the performance of the chosen technologies in the field, rather than in a best-case laboratory setting. Because this fails to recognize foreseeable risks that the liners will not perform to theoretical predictions, it does not meet NEPA requirements.",WAT,S,O,8,"PolyMet 2015d Section 3.0. PolyMet 2014r Table 2- 3, Section 2.2.4 and Attachment H; ""Good"" quality installation represents 1-4 defects/acre. This range is what PolyMet used to reflect installation methods."
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS shows a similar disregard for potential problems with the use of bentonite as a pond and bench liner at the Tailings Basin. As for other systems, the FEIS and Response to Comments simply assume that any problem can be fixed, without assessing or discussing the uncertainty of measures that might be used. Regarding concerns expressed about the untested application of bentonite plan, the Response to Comments states: “Potential measures that could bring the capture efficiency of the system to 100 percent include improvements to the existing dam such as lining the upstream dam face with bentonite and injecting grout into the dam.”172 There is no support given for this statement; it also does not acknowledge the fact that the proffered fix (another bentonite liner) is the same technology that commenters questioned in the first place. Bentonite amendment is not a universal panacea, especially when it is being used in unproven and uncertain ways that could be negated by the chemistry of the tailings at this site.",WAT,S,O,8,Barr 2015e Section 4
Erin Mittag,"Concerning comments like Dr. Malusis’s regarding the implausible uses of bentonite proposed in the preferred alternative, the response states: [P]ublications indicate that uniform blending is important, so that amendments would probably be applied in multiple layers, and that site-specific field tests would be required prior to full-scale application to tailings surfaces or the tailings pond bottom. . . . The [bentonite amendment] plan would be updated as necessary as part of facility permitting, with future in-laboratory material testing performed to confirm percentage of bentonite addition requirements, and with in-field test plots constructed preceding initial cover construction activities to confirm material placement procedures. The specific methods for bentonite amendment at the Tailings Basin, including a material testing program and construction quality control plan would require approval by the facility engineer of record and PolyMet prior transitioning to full-scale implementation.173 This is a misunderstanding of how a NEPA document is meant to function. To the extent that the agencies agree that the effectiveness of bentonite amendments and application to the pond bottom are still untested and unproven—and therefore in need of field and laboratory tests—the environmental review cannot simply assume that the strategy will be successful. The Co-Lead Agencies cannot rely on unproven mitigation measures. As water pollution due to seepage is one of the large risks of this project, it is wholly inappropriate to put off necessary tests until after the FEIS is finalized, and even more inappropriate to assume that the results of those tests will be favorable.",WAT,S,O,8,"PolyMet 2015d, Section 5.2.3"
Erin Mittag,"In his report prepared in response to the FEIS, Dr. Malusis shows that the analysis remains flawed on key issues. He points out that mixing bentonite into tailings will be less effective than assumed. Tailings “metals will inhibit bentonite swelling as the bentonite hydrates within the mixture, possibly to the extent that the bentonite will not adequately plug the voids in the mixture. If this is the case, then the bentonite-amended tailings layer will be a poor water/oxygen barrier.”174 The current proposals for bentonite additions to dams will not effectively block water or oxygen, and therefore all of the predictions of water quality impacts that are dependent on this mitigation measure are incorrect. Dr. Malusis also indicates that important information is still missing from the FEIS. The inconsistencies regarding, and uncertainty of effectiveness for, bentonite- amended dam raises must be disclosed in the FEIS, along with disclosure of the potential environmental impacts should the plan prove less effective than assumed.",WAT,S,N,8,"The Final EIS appropriately considers the potential performance of the tailings basin cover, where proposed management of this project feature includes adaptive management provisions. Specifically, the bottom cover thickness, or the percentage of bentonite in the pellets or grains, or both can be changed if monitored water quantity or quality suggested that modifications were needed to meet resource objectives. The modifications can occur before or after installation to modify performance. See FEIS page 5-238. SDEIS Themes WR 057, WR 060-2. See PolyMet 2015d Section 5.4.3.2"
Erin Mittag,"While the DNR regulation (discussed above in the section on the Dry Stack Tailings Alternative) requiring either that the tailings be rendered nonreactive or that essentially all water be prevented from moving through the tailings175 is not mentioned in the FEIS, we would like to point out that the bentonite amendment strategy will not meet this requirement. As Dr. Malusis explains, the design proposed for the Flotation Tailings Basin does not sufficiently prevent the incursion of water. Indeed, it is designed to allow a fourth of the annual precipitation to percolate into and through the basin, and is likely to be even less effective than designed. Environmental Impact Statements must demonstrate compliance both with NEPA and with other environmental laws.176 The failure of the proposed project to meet regulatory requirements in this case is a good illustration of the wisdom of this NEPA requirement. No FEIS should be deemed adequate when it envisions an illegal outcome as a preferred alternative.",PER,S,N,8,SDEIS Theme PER 05
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS and supporting documents do not address the uncertainties of the proposed leachate barrier and collection systems at the Category 1 Stockpile and the Tailings Basin. These systems are assumed to collect more than 90 percent of the leachate from these mine features, and this collection rate is critical to all of the predictions of water quality impacts from this project. If these systems do not operate as assumed, the increases in pollutants in surface and groundwater at both the mine and plant site will be significantly higher than predicted in the FEIS, to the point of violating or increasing violations of water quality standards for some constituents. For systems modeled at 99 or 100 percent capture efficiency, a change of even one percent could double the amount of pollutants predicted to enter ground and surface water. In response to questions about the adequacy of the capture systems, the FEIS contains new information showing modeling of the operation of the capture systems.177 Dr. Tom Myers has provided a comprehensive review of this modeling.178 As Dr. Myers concluded regarding the Tailings Basin system, The FEIS’ statement “[m]odel results indicate that all seepage from the Tailings Basin would be captured along the north and northwest flowpaths under all assumptions of the bedrock fracture zone thickness” is true only because the model was set up in a highly biased fashion. The model was set up to confirm: “These results indicate that the Plan site Goldsim model assumption (that groundwater seepage equal to 10 percent of the aquifer’s transmissive capacity bypasses the Tailings Basin containment system) is conservative” The model was hardwired to show what the modelers were told by Polymet to make it show. The evidence for this is that the model parameters do not resemble the parameters used for other modeling and the boundaries were set to create hydraulic barriers and sinks that will not be present in the field.179 In his review of the SDEIS, Dr. Michael Malusis also identified numerous questions and concerns regarding the barriers. For the Category I Waste Rock Stockpile, EIS documentation: lacks information on soil content and a potential additional barrier in the wall; indicates an incorrect liner will be used for a vertical wall; is based in part on missing information (i.e. broken links in reference materials and missing documents referenced) and insufficient explanation; presumes an unrealistic permeable conductivity rate for the vertical barriers; lacks information on keying walls to bedrock; is not clear about wall thickness; and indicates an insufficient surface slope which will lead to ponding and infiltration. The Tailing Basin’s groundwater seepage containment system’s documentation similarly lacks information on wall keying and inward gradient, and indicates a wall thickness that will be too difficult to construct and backfill properly and is not consistent with conventional practice. It appears from the response to comments that no significant additions were made to the FEIS to correct these many omissions and mistakes. As discussed above, reliance on a mitigation measure to avoid disclosing possible impacts of a project requires sufficient evidence for the assumption that the mitigation measure will work as planned, and/or a disclosure of the degree of risk that it will not work as planned along with information about the potential impacts if it does not. Instead of providing this assessment, the FEIS and Response to Comments tell us that the barrier and capture system is both a well-established technology, and a new technology for which historic information about the efficacy of such systems is irrelevant. In hailing the groundbreaking uniqueness of the capture systems, the Response to Comments states: The Co-lead Agencies acknowledge that there are existing water containment systems at other mine sites that do not operate with a high degree of capture, but these are different designs and cannot be directly compared to the system proposed for the NorthMet Project Proposed Action. The proposed containment system uses pumping on the tailings side and reinjection on the downgradient side to reverse hydraulic gradients across the slurry wall and in underlying bedrock. Relatively few containment systems have been built with this degree of pumping and reinjection to ensure effective capture. The conceptual hydraulics of this type of system provides evidence that it would achieve complete or nearly complete capture.180 In other words, the Co-lead Agencies are not relying on evidence that this technology has worked at this level of capture before. The only evidence it has for its assumption of greater than 90 percent capture (and in some places, 100 percent capture) is “conceptual hydraulics.” However, the FEIS states in another place that The proposed containment system technology is not new nor unique; the slurry cutoff wall and collection trench approach has been used for many decades, beginning initially as a means to facilitate construction of deep foundations in locations of shallow groundwater and difficult soil conditions, and subsequently expanding to other uses such as the containment of contaminated groundwater emanating from unlined waste disposal facilities (e.g., landfills, stockpiles, etc.). There are many papers written about the use of groundwater containment systems and a number of contractors well-experienced and proficient in containment system construction.181 The comment that this text responds to specifically challenges the assumption that the capture efficiency will be greater than 90 percent.182 Thus the response that the proposed technology “is not new or unique” and “there are many papers written” about it refers to a “unique” technology for which the agencies have no evidence other than conceptual hydraulics. Notably, no citations are provided for the papers. Similarly, in response to comments that the chosen control technologies have never been proven in this type of mining, the agencies cite to a 1986 USACE manual in support of the statement: “Design criteria for the Tailings Basin are based on well-established geotechnical design standards with significant precedent in Minnesota, in the greater United States, and worldwide.”183 In short, the agencies tout “significant precedent” for use of slurry wall technology when commenters point out the complete lack of information on the practical, as-built efficacy of the reverse hydraulic gradient system. And when commenters point out the ineffectiveness of slurry wall technology as shown by “significant precedent,” the agencies tout the uniqueness of the hydraulic system. In neither situation is the comment actually responded to. Despite this attempt to confuse the issue, it is clear that the Co-lead Agencies have no documented examples of situations in which this type of system has worked at the level of accuracy that the FEIS assumes. Given that these walls will be miles long and that the systems will need to continue operating for hundreds of years, assumptions that they will operate perfectly defy belief. Our expert reports provide many reasons to doubt these assumptions. In light of the lack of precedent and the resulting uncertainty in the capture rate of these systems, one would think that the amount of leachate escaping from the Category I Stockpile and the Tailings Basin would be set as variable factors in the GoldSim modeling, allowing a picture of what might happen if the",WAT,S,O,8,"Comparison of Myers Flow/Transport Model with Agency EIS Models September 21, 2015; PolyMet 2015h Attachment C & E; PolyMet 2015i Attachments A, B, & C; FEIS pg. 5-240; Barr 2015e"

Yet the underlying documents demonstrate that the materials in the HRF will undergo “an initial rapid flush of acidity and metals,” and will remain acidic over time.185 As noted by Dr. Chambers and Dr. Malusis in both comments submitted herewith and previous comments, substantial concerns remain regarding stability and potential impacts of the HRF.

Erin Mittag,"As with other systems, the FEIS fails to discuss any potential difficulties and breakdowns that the Waste Water Treatment Plant and Facility might face, despite the assumption that they will have to operate for centuries. Rather than discussing the uncertainties of scaling up to large facilities from the pilot scale testing and the inherent uncertainties of adjustments needed to meet discharge limits for all constituents, the FEIS simply assumes that an answer will be found for any unexpected results. Rather than responding to questions about the uncertain efficacy of meeting the applicable standards at the necessary scale, the Response to Comments focuses on the ability to increase capacity, and to continue treating and/or storing water during any breakdowns. But these responses do not address uncertainty relating to the systems’ ability to meet the discharge limits in the first place. Although reverse osmosis (RO) may be “standard technology that has been operated around the world for decades,”186 the FEIS and supporting documents provide no examples of it meeting the discharge limits that will apply here, at the scale it will need to operate. And please note that we are not saying that it cannot be done; we are saying that there is uncertainty involved and no resolution of the issue. The FEIS must reveal that uncertainty along with the range of impacts on water quality that might result if it does not work as well in reality as it did in a small pilot test.",WAT,S,N,8,"FEIS 5-236 to 5-238: The WWTF processes could be adapted depending on actual water quality conditions encountered during the NorthMet Project Proposed Action phases and estimated by water quality monitoring and model updating.

See Final EIS Section 5.2.2.3.5."
Erin Mittag,"Regardless of the technology involved or the size of the plant, wastewater treatment facilities are not immune from accidents and failures, and most modes of failure involve human error.188 For example, it may be the case that in RO systems “membrane failure tends to be gradual and provide advanced warning,”189 but acting on that warning requires human reliability. The best way to estimate the potential for accidents, failures, and releases due to human error is not to examine the technology but to refer to history. The greatest failure of the FEIS in regard to risk assessment of the water treatment systems is its failure to disclose what it will mean for water quality (and the humans and wildlife that depend on it) if waste water treatment ends prematurely due to a disruption in regulatory or financial institutions. As discussed above, given the timeframes involved this is not a “remote or highly speculative” possibility, and thus must be discussed in the FEIS.190 The public deserves to know the quality of water that will be released if treatment ends prematurely, and decision makers need this information in order to take a “hard look” at what they are approving. The EPA assessment of potential mining in Bristol Bay provides an example of disclosure of the impacts of a treatment plant failure.191 The assessment provides the following description of difficulties with RO systems: Studies of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) efficiency and design considerations show that reverse osmosis water treatment systems can be compromised by fouling and scaling from calcium, iron, barium, strontium, silica, microbial growth, and silt (Mortazavi 2008). The Bingham Canyon WWTP in Utah treats groundwater contaminated with sulfate and total dissolved solids from copper mining by reverse osmosis. Pilot tests and optimization studies have shown that the structural integrity of its reverse osmosis membranes can be damaged by abrasive materials (e.g., silt) or chlorine (ITRC 2010). Changes in water composition could increase the concentration of chlorine if the mine pit encounters a large flow of brine transmitted to the pit through deep fracture systems, or from localized areas of mineralized rock with anomalous water quality. An example of WWTP failure due to highly variable chemical composition of inflow wastewater has been documented at a copper mine in Chile: when silica concentrations exceeded the design range, the whole reverse osmosis system could not be operated and was therefore shut down until feed water quality improved (Shao et al. 2009).192 Once again, although it may be true that these difficulties can be dealt with if maintenance, replacement, and repairs are performed as needed, it is exactly the failure of maintenance, replacement, and repairs that leads to accidents and unintended releases. The EPA assessment concludes: Although it is highly likely that mine operations would adversely affect water quality at the mine site, several factors make it difficult to predict the level of effects and consequent risks to fish. One component of this uncertainty is associated with the likelihood of water collection and treatment failure. Water collection and treatment failures have been documented at 13 of 14 porphyry copper mines in the United States (Earthworks 2012). These 13 cases represent instances in which engineering uncertainties led to prediction failures, despite the fact that mine permits included mitigation measures intended to prevent such occurrences. These results indicate that failures are not uncommon at modern U.S. copper mines; however, they cannot be used to quantitatively predict the likelihood of water collection and treatment failures in this or future assessments. Even in the absence of failures, predicting the effects of mining on water quality is difficult and results are uncertain. Further, the effects of water quality changes on aquatic communities are uncertain. The following factors contribute to these uncertainties. ? The range of potential failures is wide and the probability of occurrence for any of them cannot be estimated from available data. Therefore, we can only state that, based on the record of the mining industry, treatment failures of some sort are likely to occur.193 As stated by Dr. Miller, RO systems are notoriously difficult. This is an extremely complex system, and the likelihood that it will encounter problems is at least as likely at the 13 other locations studied in the Earthworks report.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 144
Erin Mittag,"The plan to pump and treat water from the East Pit as it is filling is a mitigation measure designed to help meet groundwater standards. This strategy is unproven and receives only limited attention in the FEIS and its reference documents. The FEIS fails to respond substantively to SDEIS comments asking for further explanation and details. It also fails to provide any discussion of the uncertainty involved or the risk of unplanned difficulties. The strategy is to “rinse” the rock in the backfilled East Pit, with the goal of flushing out constituents to improve water quality in the pit. The plan calls for pumping water out of the backfilled East Pit at a rate of 1750 gallons per minute (gpm), treating the water and returning it to the pit. However, the record does not appear to include any evaluation of the uncertainties of pumping water at this high rate from the backfilled pit, or whether the rock in the pit is certain to remain saturated while pumping at that rate.194 The FEIS fails to assess the risk that pumping at the rates described could desaturate the contents of the East Pit, thereby exposing the most reactive rock (Category 2, 3 and 4) to oxygen that may result in the generation of pollution that subaqueous disposal is intended to limit. It appears that PolyMet proposes to add water back in at the same rate that it pumps water out, and therefore operates on the assumption that the rock will remain saturated. But water that is added back into a backfilled pit will follow preferential flowpaths, which may leave some areas unsaturated.195 The NorthMet Project Water Modeling Data Package notes that: “After Mine Year 31 the WWTF can accept more water from the East Pit due to decreasing flows from other sources, and the quantity extracted from the East Pit is allowed in the model to increase.”196 But the FEIS does not evaluate the uncertainty and the potential risks of increasing pumping beyond the already high 1,750 gpm rate.",WAT,S,O,8,FEIS pgs. 5-101 to 5-102. SDEIS Theme WR131. If pumps fail they would be replaced.
Erin Mittag,"Nor does the FEIS provide examples of mines where the rinsing of a pit was successfully achieved in the manner in which PolyMet proposes. The FEIS lacks the description and analysis of this proposed method necessary to assess its mitigation potential or to ensure the method itself does not cause significant environmental harm. The Response to Comments on this issue provides only unsubstantiated assurance: FEIS Section 5.2.2.3.1 accurately describes how East Pit backfill would be flooded as it is emplaced during operations to maintain water within 5ft of the backfill surface using effluent from the WWTF and storm water runoff. The Co-lead Agencies’ review of the model found that the footprints and depths of East/Central Pit are correctly incorporated into the three-dimensional model mesh, and that appropriate boundary conditions are used to simulate pit inflows. During reclamation (year 21 – 40), “water from the East Pit would also be pumped to the WWTF and treated...”, after which treatment of water in the East Pit may continue into closure and long- term maintenance197 However, Section 5.2.2.3.1 provides only general statements of what is proposed and does not describe the “three-dimensional model mesh” or other details of the method, much less a response to concerns that discharge back into the pit would follow preferential flowpaths and leave areas of reactive rock unsaturated. Rather than providing data, analysis, or examples to support the certainty that the plan will operate as intended, the FEIS Response to Comments simply restates the belief that all areas of the pit will remain saturated: “The Co-lead Agencies believe that the existing plans, as described in the FEIS, are sufficient to ensure that the East Pit backfill would remain saturated perpetually beyond closure.”198 This reliance on a mitigation measure, whose efficacy is not supported by the record, and the failure to discuss the risks and uncertainties of the method, violate NEPA requirements",WAT,S,N,8,The Final EIS response considers the comment an appropriate scale.

Erin Mittag,"PolyMet’s MODFLOW modeling ignored the backfill added to the pits and the pit lake in the West Pit in their simulation. The backfill properties would control the amount of water required to fill the pit, but the model did not adjust the properties from those of bedrock to emulate backfill during the pit refilling. As the water levels recover into a backfilled pit, the uppermost part of the backfill would be an unconfined aquifer and the backfill will would require five times as much water to saturate as would bedrock. The West Pit would be a large open volume but the modeling did not change properties to reflect that fact. A lake would require twenty times the amount of water as compared to bedrock with specific yield equal to 0.05.",WAT,S,N,12,"See PolyMet 2015m, Table 1-1: Input Variables for the Mine Site Data Package.

Erin Mittag,"The Conservation Organizations recognized the fundamental flaws with PolyMet’s water modeling early in the process. Viewing it as insufficient merely to suggest changes to PolyMet’s model, we commissioned Dr. Myers to generate his own water model to demonstrate what a more accurate model without PolyMet’s flawed assumptions would look like. That model is described in Dr. Myers’s comments on the SDEIS in 2014. But the purpose of this modeling was not merely to generate a different, competing water model; it was to give the Co-Lead Agencies additional expertise on which to base their own model. As described in Myers 2015 at 5 - 6, hydrology models can benefit greatly from multiple conceptual models. It is not that one model is better than another, but that multiple models are optimal. But they are only optimal if the modelers choose to take advantage of them. In this case, the Co-Lead Agencies were dismissive rather than accepting of Dr. Myers’s expertise.",WAT,S,O,8,"Comparison of Myers Flow/Transport Model with Agency EIS Models September 21, 2015"
Erin Mittag,"In response to comments, the Co-Lead Agencies asked Barr Engineering to prepare, among other documents, a Memorandum on the four containment systems, and a sensitivity analysis of various inputs into the water model. The Memorandum on the containment systems begins as follows: The Co-Lead Agencies have requested a summary of the four containment systems that are planned for the NorthMet Project (Mine Site and Flotation Tailings Basin [FTB]) and the justification for how they are represented in the water quality (GoldSim) modeling. This memorandum represents the rationale for the modeling assumptions for each of the following containment systems: ● FTB Seepage Containment System (north and west) ● FTB Seepage Containment System (east) ● FTB South Seepage Management System ● Category 1 Waste Rock Stockpile Groundwater Containment System. The Co-Lead Agencies requested a “justification” for how the containment systems are represented—not a response to substantive questions raised by public comment. Notice also that the Co-Lead Agencies did not request this “justification” from their own staff or consultants, but from the project proponents consultants. According to the project proponent’s consultant, capturing 100 percent of the surface water discharge and 90 percent of the groundwater discharge is a “conservative” assumption. In a second memo prepared by Barr entitled “Sensitivity Analysis of the NorthMet Water Quality Models,” Barr stated that although it would describe its sensitivity analysis to see if various changes to the model would change the outputs: Because of the proposed engineering controls and the adaptive water management strategy, it is not expected that the modeled concentrations in the Partridge River would exhibit much sensitivity to most input variables for the Mine Site water quality modeling, except those inputs that control water quantity and quality from unimpacted portions of the watersheds. If this expectation is borne out in the sensitivity analysis, the results will be positive with respect to the potential for environmental impacts: this will indicate that as long as the engineering controls perform as planned and the adaptive water management strategy is able to achieve its objectives, there is little likelihood that a mischaracterized input variable would result in unforeseen environmental outcomes. In other words, PolyMet’s consultant would do the work, but the outcome was preordained by the assumptions in the model. This demonstrates that the Co-Lead Agencies have not taken a “hard look” at the water quality impacts of the PolyMet proposal.",NEPA,NS,X,1,

Erin Mittag,"Since the close of the comment period for the SDEIS, new information has come to light regarding the potential for groundwater to flow north out of the East and West pits after closure, toward and into Northshore Mining’s PMP. The PMP will be dewatered for many years following the closure of the proposed NorthMet mine. Even after the PMP is closed and fills with water, that water will be maintained at a lower elevation than the water in the NorthMet West Pit lake and East Pit pore water, causing a northward migration of groundwater. This water will enter the PMP, from which all water will be discharged to the Rainy River watershed after mine closure, constituting a diversion of water from the Great Lakes basin to the Hudson Bay basin. This issue was brought to the Co-Lead Agencies’ attention by GLIFWC, whose position and modeling results are contained in a letter attached to these comments. Dr. Tom Myers has done additional modeling that also indicates a northward flow from the mine pits after closure.205 Remarkably, the Co-lead Agencies defend their failure to establish the likely flow paths of groundwater from the mine pits by stating that the modeling done was not intended for this purpose. The agencies as much as admit that they did not plan to require PolyMet to accurately characterize the hydrology of the site after closure, when to do so is required to obtain a water appropriation permit.206 DNR will no doubt respond that this is a permitting rather than a MEPA requirement, but when exactly is it that the required hydrological investigation and modeling was going to be done? It legally must be completed before finalization of the FEIS.",MEPA,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"PolyMet and the agencies’ response to this issue is to promise to find some form of mitigation that will prevent water from flowing to the north. At this point, the promises of mitigation have reached the point of absurdity. According to the FEIS, no matter what goes wrong at this mine, some ideal means will be found to address it. But it is abundantly clear from all evidence and all sources that this is not the way things work at similar mines. If it was, we would not have billions of dollars of contaminated mine sites spread across the country that are not being remediated because the ideal means and money to do so is not available. The FEIS provides four pages of mitigation ideas without one word about cost. GLIFWC reviewed an early version of proposed mitigation measures and responded: Given the uncertainty that the co-leads feel there is in characterization of contaminant flowpath direction, the draft co-lead memo of June 22 proposes several mitigations that attempt to prevent northward flow of contaminants. The feasibility of any of those measures has not been evaluated. Even with the minimal information presented in the memo, several obstacles to successful mitigation of a northward flowpath are evident: 1) The thickness of the low conductivity surficial deposits between the PolyMet site and the P-M pits, approximately 50 feet thick according to Minnesota Geological Survey 2005 publication M158, makes the practicality of an infiltration trench questionable; 2) Lowering of water levels in the the PolyMet pits would expose reactive Virginia Formation rock to air and water, creating acid generation and dewatering surrounding wetlands; 3) Groundwater injection or extraction wells may be a feasible, but costly, mechanism to block northward flow but, as noted in the memo, would require perpetual operation, care and replacement. In addition to the proposed adaptive management appearing to be impractical, substituting “adaptive management” for understanding of the hydrologic system is contrary to the NEPA concept of site characterization and impact prediction. NEPA is a forward-looking process with the goal of anticipating and describing impacts so that measures can be taken to avoid or minimize those impacts. A northward flowpath for contaminants is indicated by both MODFLOW and MathCad. The character of the hydrology between the PolyMet and P-M projects needs to be described correctly so that impacts of that northward flowpath can be evaluated and the feasibility of mitigation measures can be determined. In an Expert Report submitted with these comments, Dr. Tom Myers reviews the suggested mitigation possibilities, and points out: All of these measures would have to be maintained indefinitely because the northward flow gradient would last forever (Myers 2015). The FEIS has failed to prove that any of them could effectively work or that Polymet could afford to implement them. The FEIS should not rely on these mitigation strategies but rather should complete analysis to lower the uncertainty as to whether they will be needed by completing better upfront analyses of the potential for northward flow. The FEIS discussion states that proposed mitigation measures “if needed, would be maintained indefinitely or until acceptable bedrock groundwater flow conditions are obtained without those measures.”210 Acceptable bedrock groundwater flow conditions could not be guaranteed without a change in the law, which is what PolyMet seems to be banking on.",WAT,S,O,8,"Depressing pit water elevations (FEIS pg. 5-241) and treating resulting excess pit water would eliminate any chance of northward bedrock flow if it were to materialize.

The plant was permitted and began operating, but when it came time to build the water treatment system, the company couldn’t afford it, and ten years later continues to operate with a variance. Another is Reserve Mining, which promised on obtaining its permit to discharge tailings into Lake Superior that if the tailings did not settle on the lake bottom as expected, it would “take whatever action might be necessary to remedy those conditions.” The length and complexity of the legal proceedings to force it to do so are legendary.",PER,NS,X,1,

We note that the mitigation measures proposed to address potential northward flow “would not be initially included in the financial assurance package, but, if required in the future, these measures would be added to the financial assurance package.” But even if the need for the measures was established before mining ended, neither we nor the Co-Lead Agencies have any reason to believe that PolyMet would be able to afford the financial assurance when the need is discovered. At that point, the mine will be operating, and even the Great Lakes Compact is unlikely to require mitigation when the company says it will close rather than pay for such measures. It is also possible, even likely, that any northward flow will not be discovered until after PolyMet has ceased operations.

The Great Lakes Compact prohibits diversions of water out of the Great Lakes basin for anything other than public water supply. There is no minimum volume on this prohibition; another section of the Compact indicates that volumes as low as 5.7 gallons are included.

Similarly, the geochemistry work is insufficient to support realistic, defensible predictions of water quality impacts.

The combination of the uncertainty in regard to hydrology and geochemistry inputs to the model results in an overly-optimistic assessment of water quality impacts.

Erin Mittag,The FEIS must assess water quality impacts in the Partridge River at the closest point between the river and mine features.,WAT,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS must assess water quality impacts from groundwater discharge to the Partridge River at any point where those impacts may be the greatest, including the point where the river comes closest to mine features. The FEIS cannot omit impacts on the river upstream of SW-004 unless it provides adequate data showing that those impacts will be less than the impacts at SW-004 and below. This issue was raised in our comments on the SDEIS at CBD 6 - 9, which is incorporated herein by reference. We asked Keith Gadway, principle of Quantum Environmental, Inc. in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to review the FEIS and our SDEIS comments in regards to this issue. His response is included as an expert report. The methodology for assessing water quality impacts included assigning a number in the model to represent the distance between mine features and the river. This was apparently based on the average distance to the river within the flowpath.223 As such, the accuracy of the location and width of the flowpaths becomes important. FEIS Figure 5.2.2-7 shows the flowpaths as estimated for the GoldSim modeling. Note that point SW-003 is the closest point to the Partridge River from the Category 2/3 stockpile. However, the East Pit/Category 2/3 Flowpath was deliberately drawn to begin just below this point, and no assessment was made of the impact of leachate from the stockpile on surface water quality in this location.",NEPA,S,O,8,"Water Resources/Groundwater Impact Assessment Planning Memo NorthMet Project EIS June 30, 2011."
Erin Mittag,"The flowpaths shown in Figure 5.2.2-7 and used in the GoldSim model do not accurately reflect the geography and hydrology at the site. As the Response to Comments admits, the flowpaths “do not exactly line up with the flow trajectories predicted by MODFLOW.” And even if they did, the MODFLOW modeling itself was not designed to accurately identify flow paths. The FEIS makes several vague statements such as, “A secondary purpose of the MODFLOW model [including “groundwater flow directions” and “the distribution of groundwater baseflows along the Partridge River.”] An evaluation of these parameters showed that the GoldSim setup/inputs were generally consistent with the MODFLOW results.” The FEIS needs to provide sufficient information about both the MODFLOW assumptions and the consistency between the two models to allow for some judgment as to the accuracy of the flowpaths. The Co-Lead Agencies seem to begin with the assumption that there will be no significant impacts along this stretch of the river, thus making the accuracy of groundwater discharge points unimportant. As Mr. Gadway states: Impacts to the river would presumably be greatest along the primary groundwater recharge zone closest to mine operations. Based on predicted pathways for discharges to the river from mine features, monitoring and evaluation points are more than three miles downstream from this point and are just below the discharge from a creek. Selection of these monitoring and evaluation points ensures that the discharges likely to be highest in pollutant concentrations are not caught by monitoring until well downstream, having been diluted by presumably clean groundwater and by surface water from an area less likely to be affected by mine operations. The failure to monitor surface water at the actual point of contact with groundwater and surface water closest to the mine is directly contrary to Great Lakes Initiative (GLI) requirements and standards that ensure that water quality will not be lowered for impaired waters. The FEIS methodology fails to evaluate the receiving water nearest the actual discharge to the Partridge River, and therefore is inadequate to address potential impairment.",WAT,S,O,8,PolyMet 2015m Section 5.1.2.6 and 5.2.3; SDEIS COOP Response #17749

We did not find a single EIS that provided quantified information on predicted water quality at the property boundary that did not also provide information for predicted water quality in pit lakes and backfilled pits.

Sulfide mining is unique, and new to Minnesota. The “typical” approach is entirely inadequate for this atypical project. And in any event, an approach does not necessarily meet regulatory requirements just because that is the way it has been done in the past. Whatever MPCA’s practice is in permitting discharges to groundwater, that practice does not provide a limit on the impacts that must be discussed in an EIS.

Erin Mittag,"The FEIS must contain a more complete disclosure of what is known about the length of time for which water treatment will be necessary. The EIS states only that the need for water treatment is assumed to be “long-term.” However, the water quality modeling results clearly indicate that treatment is likely to be needed for more than 500 years, which is as long as the model was run. An accurate statement would be “The length of time for which water treatment will be needed is unknown, but is predicted to be more than 500 years.”",WAT,S,O,8,"Duration of Water Treatment at Mine Site and Plant Site Rationale for Thematic Response November 17, 2014; It is uncertain how long the NorthMet Project Proposed Action would require water treatment."
Erin Mittag,"The discussion of “passive” treatment in the FEIS is misleading and should be removed. The “passive” or “non-mechanical” treatment is as yet undeveloped, and there is no evidence that it will ever prove technically capable of treating water at this site to the levels used for the WWTF effluent in the water quality modeling. While the FEIS does state that the agencies are not relying on passive treatment for water quality predictions, and that the need for mechanical water treatment is assumed to be long-term, the placement of the material on passive treatment has the effect of insinuating that this assumption probably will not prove true. This insinuation in concert with the failure to define “long-term” does not provide the “hard look” at the need for perpetual treatment.233 The FEIS and supporting documents assume throughout that unproven passive treatment systems will be implemented. For instance, the FEIS contains a section describing the predicted transition from mechanical to non-mechanical treatment: As described in the Water Management section above, water modeling for the NorthMet Project Proposed Action and the environmental analysis in Chapter 5 assumes that mechanical water treatment would continue indefinitely. PolyMet would include funds in its contingency reclamation estimate and financial assurance package to operate mechanical water treatment for as long as necessary as a part of its Permit to Mine. However, the Permit to Mine would also require PolyMet to present a plan for eventual transition from mechanical water treatment to non-mechanical water treatment, and to adjust its financial assurance on an annual basis in accordance with Minnesota Rules, part 6132.1200 to conform to the transition. This section provides an overview of the transitional approach from mechanical water treatment to the use of non-mechanical treatment technologies. PolyMet would transition from mechanical to non-mechanical water treatment as soon as the company demonstrates that non-mechanical water treatment technologies would effectively treat water to meet water quality based effluent limits and as soon as formal approval is received from the agencies. Non-mechanical water treatment technologies need to be designed for site-specific conditions and actual site water quality. PolyMet accordingly would test non-mechanical water treatment technologies for several years during mine operations and reclamation, until an acceptable treatment performance could be achieved. Non- mechanical water treatment technologies can be evaluated in the following steps: 1) collection of additional local site information (i.e., hydrology and influent water quality), 2) laboratory testing, 3) pilot-scale testing, 4) design of a system for full-scale implementation, and 5) continued evaluation of effectiveness over time. The conceptual design for a non- mechanical treatment system is to treat each flow expected in the long term. The Adaptive Water Management Plan (PolyMet 2015d) outlines preliminary/conceptual information on non-mechanical treatment systems. PolyMet has initiated testing of non-mechanical water treatment technologies on site (in collaboration with Cliffs Erie) and will continue testing these systems and evaluating other non-mechanical water treatment technologies until they could be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the MDNR and MPCA to provide the required water treatment. Provisions would be included in the NorthMet Project financial assurance package to ensure this test work and implementation of the non-mechanical water treatment technologies could be completed.234 The Adaptive Water Management Plan, cited in the FEIS above, treats the transition to non-mechanical treatment as a certainty, with the only question being timing: The ultimate goal of long-term closure (Figure 2-4 and Figure 2-5) is to transition from the mechanical treatment provided by the WWTF to non-mechanical treatment. Because non-mechanical treatment designs are very site-specific and very dependent on the quality of the water to be treated, it is assumed that the WWTF will operate in the long-term and the transition to non-mechanical treatment will take place only after the performance of a non-mechanical system has been tested on site, proven effective, and approved by the agencies. The two non-mechanical treatment systems at the Mine Site are independent of each other. It is expected that the Category 1 Waste Rock Stockpile Non-Mechanical Treatment System will be deployed earlier than the West Pit Overflow Non-Mechanical Treatment System, as described in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. As noted previously, water from the Category 1 Waste Rock Stockpile will continue to be treated by the WWTF until non-mechanical treatment with gravity discharge to the West Pit has been proven to provide appropriate treatment. This may occur during reclamation or long-term closure... Operation of the WWTF will occur year-round with the discharge directed to a small watercourse that flows into the Partridge River until non-mechanical treatment has been proven effective at achieving water quality objectives.",NEPA,S,N,8,"SDEIS Themes FIN 05, FIN 06"
Erin Mittag,"PolyMet has used these statements to sow confusion in the public about the length of time for which water treatment would be required at the site. ● “But because the study focused on the water that could escape rather than water contained at the site, other factors would have to be considered to give a true estimate of how long treatment would be needed, said Brad Moore, PolyMet’s executive vice president of environmental and governmental affairs. He said company officials expect mechanical treatment, such as the reverse osmosis systems PolyMet is proposing for the mine and plant sites, would only be needed for decades. The effectiveness of passive treatment techniques such as wetlands is still being studied.”● “Moore, a former commissioner of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, also disputed the need for long-term treatment at the mine site. The company estimates mechanical water treatment will only be needed for about 40 years after the mine is closed. When the mine opens, Moore said, PolyMet would begin testing passive wetland filtering systems designed specifically for the site’s water chemistry. He said state and federal regulators chose the word ‘indefinitely” in the document to be conservative, since the reverse osmosis technology is treatment that’s already proven.” ● “One point of debate is the length of time water from the site would need to be treated after the mine closes. The environmental review includes the scenario in which water treatment could be needed for up to 200 years at the mine site and 500 years at the processing plant. But Moore said treatment won’t be needed for that long. He said the conservative modeling used assumes that all elements of the rock will enter the ground water through the weathering process, although that doesn’t happen.” PolyMet also released its own “factsheet” about long-term water treatment in which it said that “PolyMet believes that within 30 years after closure, all water will be treated by passive treatment technologies.”",WAT,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"While the Conservation Organizations recognize that PolyMet’s statements are not part of the FEIS, they are supported by statements in the FEIS that have no place in an agency document. An agency is obligated to assess the effectiveness of potential mitigation measures.240 In this case, the Co-Lead Agencies have concluded that the potential mitigation measure is not effective at all because it relies upon non-existent technology, yet continue to discuss it at multiple points throughout the FEIS, including the Executive Summary: The NorthMet Project Proposed Action includes long-term mechanical treatment (RO or equivalently performing technology) at both the Mine Site and Plant Site with a goal of transitioning to a non- mechanical water treatment technology requiring less maintenance over the long term. Pilot studies for non-mechanical treatment would be conducted during operations (and post-closure as necessary) to demonstrate the ability to transition to non-mechanical water treatment. Both mechanical and non-mechanical treatment would require periodic maintenance and monitoring activities for as long as treatment is required.241 Also, in response to public comments that treatment would be essentially perpetual, the Co-Lead Agencies responded: Minnesota Rules, part 6132.3200, Closure and Postclosure Maintenance, identifies several goals for non-ferrous mining areas, including the goal that sites be closed so that they are maintenance-free. A maintenance-free site is the goal of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) for the NorthMet Project Proposed Action, as it is for every mining site. The NorthMet Project Proposed Action includes piloting a non-mechanical treatment system to achieve this goal. PolyMet would include funds in its reclamation cost estimate and financial assurance package to fund mechanical water treatment for as long as necessary, but the Permit to Mine would require PolyMet to present a plan for eventual transition from mechanical water treatment to non-mechanical treatment. PolyMet cannot be released from its responsibilities, including financial assurance requirements, until there is no longer a need for closure/post-closure treatment/maintenance. Financial assurance is a component of any Permit to Mine, to ensure that necessary maintenance can be provided for as long as it necessary.242 Over the course of any project, technology changes and improves, and sometimes projects are implemented differently than predicted in an EIS where technology that is newer, better or less costly becomes available. Yet there is no doubt that the original 500-year predictions for water pollution in the SDEIS quickly became the most controversial aspect of this project.243 The current FEIS still concedes that mechanical treatment is required for at least 200 years at the Mine Site and 500 Years at the Plant Site.244 Thus, it appears that FEIS continually repeats the goal of non-mechanical treatment solely for political reasons to address public concerns about committing to a mine that requires hundreds of years of water treatment, rather than any justifiable belief that this is a proven mitigation measure.",NEPA,S,N,8,SDEIS Theme NEPA 09
Erin Mittag,"Furthermore, non-mechanical treatment will not meet the goal of maintenance-free closure. To repeat the Executive Summary: “Both mechanical and non-mechanical treatment would require periodic maintenance and monitoring activities for as long as treatment is required.”245 While less intensive or less frequent maintenance might be required for a non- mechanical system, in some respects this could add to the potential that failures and problems would go undetected. In any event, representing that non-mechanical treatment would meet the maintenance-free goal of the regulations is simply false.",PER,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme PER 04; SDEIS COOP Response #3111
Erin Mittag,"In summary, the many statements about transition to non-mechanical treatment mislead the public and agency decision- makers into believing that non-mechanical treatments exist that will work at this site, and that they will eliminate concerns over the length of time that treatment will be needed. Neither of these things are true. These statements should be removed.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS does not address the need for pumping and treating water from areas adjacent to the pits during mining, or the potential for elevated concentrations of nitrate and ammonia from blasting agents. The FEIS failed to take a “hard look” at the possibility that runoff from the area around the pits could have elevated concentrations of nitrate and ammonia from blasting agents, and that the area around the pits will need to be dewatered by pumping. The FEIS thus failed to consider the need for this additional pumping, which would add water to the total to be treated, including the need to treat process water for ammonium and nitrate. Mine water that has been in contact with blasting agents, including leachate from stockpile materials stored at the mine site and the pit walls, will have elevated concentrations of ammonia and nitrate from the use of high volumes of blasting agents such as emulsifiers, boosters, and ammonium nitrate – fuel oil (ANFO). The treatment pilot tests, however, assumed that mine water would have near-background levels of nitrate and ammonia, and so the effectiveness of the selected methods for removal of these constituents under mining conditions has not been properly tested or considered. The FEIS discloses that large amounts of explosives will be needed to create the open pits: 18,650 lb/yr for the booster, 4.65 million lb/yr for the emulsion, and 10.6 million lb/yr for ANFO. As result, nitrate, ammonia, and oil & grease concentrations could be high in primary contaminant sources at mine sites and downstream. For instance, the significant exceedence of permit limits for nitrate in downgradient groundwater and surface water has been seen at the Buckhorm Mine. However, while the FEIS lists that the “environmental concern” from these hazardous materials includes harm to water and aquatic life, the FEIS fails to actually consider and address the effects of blasting on water quality. Indeed the objectives for wastewater treatment at the Mine Site do not even include mention of nitrate or ammonia removal. The agencies’ response to comments on this issue is inadequate. First, no response was provided for concerns about ammonia removal. And for treatment of nitrates, the response states that the WWTF will also be of modular construction, such that additional modules can be added for increased capacity if necessary. However, because nitrate, ammonia, and oil & grease concentrations will increase as soon as blasting begins (during mine development), treatment approaches cannot be addressed using adaptive management but must rather be in place before mining begins.252 The response also states that nitrate will be addressed at the Plant Site if nitrate is included in the discharge permit.253 However, much of the water at the Plant Site comes from the Mine Site, and the response ignores the potential for transport of mine water to downgradient groundwater and surface water at the Mine Site. The FEIS also fails to address that neither chemical precipitation nor filtration, which are the planned treatment schemes at the mine site, will remove nitrate or ammonia. The FEIS further fails to properly address nitrate and ammonia in environmental modeling. And, the FEIS fails to include mitigation measures or pollution prevention plans for minimizing the use of blasting chemicals.",WAT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WR 032

Erin Mittag,"We pointed out in our SDEIS comments that the air deposition analysis fails to quantify the amount of mercury that will be deposited in the Embarrass and Partridge Rivers from air emissions, despite the obvious availability of this information. This point is reiterated by Keith Gadway in his expert report submitted with the current comments. The FEIS reports on the change in mass loading of mercury in the Embarrass and Partridge Rivers, but does not include the load from air deposition, which misinforms readers. The Response to Comments states “The increase [from air deposition] would not be expected to have any appreciable effect on the loading estimates from permitted discharges to the Embarrass River, Partridge River, or the lower St. Louis River.”257 As far as we can tell, this is simply untrue. According to the FEIS, the “loading estimates from permitted discharges” are an increase of 0.2 grams per year to the Embarrass River,258 and a decrease of 1.2 grams per year to the Partridge River.259 In contrast, the deposition analysis indicates that the increased load from air emissions from the NorthMet Project would be between 5.88 and 21.06 grams per year to the Embarrass River (upstream of Sabin Lake), and between 4.62 and 16.35 grams per year to the Partridge River (upstream of Colby Lake).260 If the estimates for the watershed of these two lakes do not reflect the load to the upstream rivers, please explain why in the NEPA document.261 If they do reflect the load to the upstream rivers, it is impossible to reconcile the numbers with the words “no appreciable effect.”",MERC,S,N,8,"SDEIS Theme MERC 08. Barr 2015f 4.3.5.1, 4.3.5.2. The Final EIS acknowledges that under certain localized conditions the introduction of sulfate to a water resource may contribute to the production of methyl mercury. However when taken as a whole, the project would result in a reduction of the loading and concentration of sulfate within the Embarrass River watershed and that this overall reduction would likely not result in adverse effects on downstream resources from mercury methylation. It is this concept that formed the basis for the MPCA strategy (MPCA 2006a) to address the indirect effects of sulfate on methyl mercury production. It is noted that sulfate that discharges directly into streams only enhances methyl mercury if it interacts extensively with organic carbon along the flow path to the stream or as it moves downstream. Empirical evidence from around the Iron Range (comparing low and high sulfate rivers - where sulfate is introduced from the sumping of pits) reveal that once in the river, sulfate interaction with organic matter is usually insufficient to impact methylmercury that comes from other background sources"
Erin Mittag,The Response to Comments also misrepresents the air deposition analysis as having been done by MPCA.262 The analysis was actually performed by Barr Engineering on behalf of PolyMet.,MERC,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS also fails to quantify mercury discharging to surface water through groundwater. We pointed out in our comments on the SDEIS that methods are available to model mercury transport to surface water through groundwater. The EPA suggested one such method in its comment letter of March 13, 2015: “If GoldSim is not suitable to model this pollutant, elemental mercury can be modeled using a different water quality model, such as the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP), which is commonly used by EPA to model elemental mercury.” Keith Gadway suggests another: “Simplified mercury modeling for point concentrations are available in MINTEQ to evaluate chemical equilibrium and, when coupled with a transport model such as MODFLOW, can provide useful data.” In SDEIS comments, CBD submitted an example of groundwater mercury transport modeling that was done for a mine in Michigan. The FEIS and Response to Comments do not explain why none of these methods were used.",MERC,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme MERC 09. Barr 2015f pg. 48
Erin Mittag,The FEIS takes the position that the mass balance studies are an adequate substitute for modeling. But the West Pit mass balance study does not account for the mercury that will escape from mine features through groundwater.,MERC,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme MERC 09
Erin Mittag,"The mass balance treats that mercury as being collected and settling out in the West Pit or tailings basin, which is erroneous. The Response to Comments ignores this point, and simply reiterates that the mass balance study was done to characterize mercury releases.",MERC,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"It is possible that the greatest source of mercury to the Partridge River from groundwater transport from mine features would be the Overburden Storage and Laydown Area (OSLA). A large volume of peat will be excavated and stored in this area; as pointed out in Keith Gadway’s report, peat is known to sequester mercury and to release it when excavated and exposed to wetting and drying. In addition, the OSLA will be unlined, and a larger volume of groundwater will enter the river from this source than from any other mine feature. Furthermore, mercury from this source will enter the river prior to the time that the Waste Water Treatment Facility (WWTF) begins discharging treated water to the river (which is expected to dilute concentrations of pollutants that enter from the groundwater flowpaths). Discharge of mercury from this source will occur prior to the time of the predicted decrease of 1.2 grams per year in mercury load. While several “Theme Statements” in the Response to Comments point this out, the responses never address it. The response to MERC 20 is typical. The discussion only mentions water that is routed to Pond PW-OSLA, which is routed from there to the Tailings Basin or mine pits.

This position is based on shake- flask tests that do not stand up to scientific scrutiny. These tests are wholly insufficient for the purpose they are used for, as explained in our SDEIS comments.

Pilot testing of the RO system did not include treatment for mercury, and the level at which the systems will remove mercury is simply unknown.268 The FEIS assumption that the WWTF and WWTP will be able to achieve a 1.3 ng/L mercury concentration in effluent appears to based on projections that influent will be below at or below that level.269 Although the FEIS states several times that RO technology is “known to remove mercury,”270 the FEIS treats the level of removal as essentially irrelevant, because the analysis has already been manipulated to indicate that the influent will meet the water quality standard. Before this project is permitted, the agencies must correct errors and base mercury levels in influent on scientifically acceptable evidence, followed by a scientifically sound analysis of the mercury removal capabilities of the treatment systems.",MERC,S,O,8,Barr 2013f Section 7
Erin Mittag,"We note that the mercury removal efficiencies in literature cited in the Pilot Testing Report will not necessarily transfer to the treatment of influent from the NorthMet project. Removal of mercury at very low levels to meet the 1.3 ng/L standard is notoriously difficult, far more difficult than (for instance) achieving 99.9 percent reduction for an influent of 6 ug/L mercury, which still leaves the effluent significantly above the 1.3 ng/L standard.",MERC,NS,X,1,"The basis for citing a 6,000 ng/L influent is unclear."
Erin Mittag,"In its discussion of adaptive management, the FEIS states, “Adaptive management would be implemented as necessary based on monitoring for total mercury to determine whether the treated water could be discharged to surface waters, or whether some additional treatment is needed. ""The text goes on to discuss possible treatments, but provides no information on how effective they have proven to be. This is not adaptive management, which would identify the trigger point at which adaptation would be required, along with measures that have been proven to give the necessary results and what they would cost.",O,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"Furthermore, adaptive management cannot be used as a means to avoid the necessity of providing a scientifically defensible analysis of mercury levels in the waste water treatment influent and effluent. Regulatory agencies cannot simply accept PolyMet’s optimistic belief about influent mercury levels and wait until the WWTF and WWTP are built to test the effluent to find out if it needs additional treatment. At that point, several years of discharges at above the water quality standard are likely to have happened, discharges that would not have been permitted had they been properly assessed before the mine was built.",MERC,S,O,11,SDEIS Theme MERC 04
Erin Mittag,"Finally, we note that while discharge of Colby Lake water without treatment for flow augmentation is no longer proposed, it is unclear whether Colby Lake water might at times be routed directly to the WWTP, for discharge to the environment below the tailings basin.272 Colby Lake water averages approximately 6 ng/L mercury, and the FEIS provides no evidence that the WWTP will be able to treat it to the 1.3 ng/L standard. The responses to comments addressing this issue repeatedly refer the reader to the FEIS section on monitoring for more information. Promises of monitoring cannot take the place of providing adequate evidence that discharge will meet the 1.3 ng/L standard—not just on average, but on a regular basis.",WAT,S,N,2,PolyMet proposes to discharge treated Colby Lake water to Second Creek.

Erin Mittag,"As explained in our comments on the SDEIS, in the absence of site-specific data the wetlands at both the mine and plant sites must be considered to already violate the water quality standard for mercury. The FEIS includes a prediction that a certain number of acres of wetlands may suffer water quality impacts due to groundwater transport and air deposition. Mercury from the project will enter the wetlands from both sources, contributing to water quality standard exceedances in violation of the Clean Water Act. PolyMet’s attempts to avoid the law by refusing to model or otherwise provide scientifically defensible estimates of releases of mercury (to both wetlands and streams) or other solutes (to wetlands) should not be countenanced by regulatory agencies. The Co-Lead Agencies’ willingness to adopt PolyMet’s position does not do justice to the people of Minnesota, who expect to see our environmental laws respected and enforced.",PER,S,O,11,
Erin Mittag,"We recognize that the amount of mercury in this case is small compared to the mass of mercury circling the globe and coming down in precipitation, but we do not agree that this makes it insignificant. Mercury in the environment is a serious public health issue, especially in Northeastern Minnesota. It is a cumulative problem; the mercury load to any particular water body comes from thousands of sources. When the Great Lakes Initiative (GLI) was adopted, it was with the recognition that drastic measures were needed to address this issue, and a complete prohibition was placed on new or increased discharges of mercury to any water body in the Lake Superior basin, including the Embarrass River. The mining industry might find it inconvenient, but the decision was made after a lengthy process with extensive public input, and that public now expects the law to be followed. This is Co-Lead Agencies’ clear duty.",PER,S,O,11,
Erin Mittag,"In Minnesota the prohibition on new or increased mercury discharges extends to wetlands through the application of water quality standard regulations. This is particularly appropriate in regards to mercury, because wetlands play such a significant role in producing methylmercury, which in turn makes fish unsafe to eat.",PER,S,O,11,
Erin Mittag,"The NorthMet project will also increase sulfate levels in wetlands, which may plan an even greater role in increased mercury methylation. We note that the FEIS added an analysis indicating a potential increase in sulfate levels in wetlands from air deposition alone at 1.7 mg/L, after dilution from precipitation. While the FEIS treats this as negligible, it is actually quite a substantial addition to wetland waters. We were unable to find any baseline information about water quality in the wetlands at the NorthMet site, and our understanding is that there is none. The “background” sulfate level in surface water in Minnesota is often estimated at 3.0 mg/L or below; we assume this is an approximate level for wetlands at the mine site at least. If so, increases from air deposition alone would be as high as 50 percent. Although MPCA estimates that any waters with a current sulfate level above 40 mg/L are “high risk” waters for increased mercury methylation, this does not mean that sulfate does not significantly increase methylation of mercury at much lower levels. Increasing sulfates from 3.0 to 4.7 mg/L in wetlands would be expected to significantly increase mercury methylation. Note that even with similarly low levels of sulfates in most northern Minnesota waters, we have a dire situation in regards to mercury in fish tissue. Small increases in both mercury and sulfate in the water of extensive wetland areas are virtually certain to increase mercury methylation, and to lead to increased mercury levels in fish tissue and in fish-eating wildlife. Methylmercury is known to build to high levels in this situation, flushing out to area streams and lakes with snowmelt or floods. This phenomenon is expected to increase in Minnesota with global warming. The increases in mercury and sulfate that can be expected from the proposed project are likely to result in significant impacts, and thus must be properly assessed in the FEIS; monitoring cannot take the place of this assessment.",MERC,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes MERC 02, MERC 09"

The FEIS still fails to adequately disclose, analyze, or discuss a number of questions regarding the environmental effects of the PolyMet mine and processing facility on area wetlands, addressing few of the questions and issues raised in the extensive comments on the SDEIS. Therefore, the Conservation Organizations restate and incorporate in their entirety, the comments and accompanying expert reports of MCEA, Friends, and CBD on wetlands and related issues regarding hydrology, air deposition, and financial assurance. The Conservation Organizations address below the change from the SDEIS to the FEIS identifying a number of wetlands as not likely to be indirectly affected to “low likelihood” of indirect effects, as well as a few of the relevant responses to comments (and their failure to adequately address issues raised).

Erin Mittag,"17.1 Wetland identification and classification is impermissibly skipped over in the FEIS.One of the primary issues raised in comments on the SDEIS concerned the failure to adequately classify and the potential misclassification of minerotrophic wetlands as opposed to ombrotrophic wetlands. While Eggers’ January 2015 Memorandum appears to agree with Dr. Glaser regarding the references and guidance to be used in such identification, the FEIS is at best conflicted, and at worst simply wrong, in its approach to identifying project-affected wetlands as either ombrotrophic or minerotrophic and the resulting potential for negative effects and type of negative effect. Instead of identifying wetlands that may be affected and their type, the FEIS now simply assigns a “low likelihood” of effect to area wetlands in an effort to avoid assessing wetland character as minerotrophic and to negate or minimize the importance of identifying specific wetlands as minerotrophic in the affected area. While it is correct that this is a slightly more conservative approach than the approach originally taken in the SDEIS, it is neither an accurate nor complete approach and tends to trivialize why it is important in environmental review to make the distinction. Type of wetland will be relevant for more than assessing indirect effects as a result of hydrology and it is a required component of an EIS as well as for the analysis for the purposes of issuing a C.W.A. § 404 permit.",WET,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WET 09
Erin Mittag,"First, as discussed below, hydrology is not the only manner in which wetlands will be and are affected by the project, but it is a component among several. In order to fully understand effects, all ways in which wetlands might be affected should be addressed. Therefore, simply changing the NEPA document conclusion from no likelihood of effect to low likelihood does nothing to address the overall potential for effects to area wetlands, including the heightened potential for effects to minerotrophic wetlands and their unique characteristics.",WET,S,N,2,The FEIS identifies the multiple ways indirect effects can materialize (pg. 5-259) and the probability of those effects occurring.
Erin Mittag,"Second, low likelihood as a blanket statement utterly fails to demonstrate the required level of analysis and disclosure for an EIS. There is no analysis in this blanket probability statement in the FEIS. A generic statement about all wetlands on and around the site tells the co-lead agencies, decision-makers, and the public absolutely nothing about what may occur as a result of the project and what is lost because of it. And the blanket “low likelihood” statement, absent assessment and analysis of wetlands that are actually in the area and their hydrologic character, is simply inaccurate. It is unlikely that all ombrotrophic and minerotrophic wetlands in the area are vulnerable to effects from the project in the exact same manner and degree. This is not analysis based upon evidence and science; this is just an effort to escape the requirements for environmental review. Third, the blanket “low likelihood” coupled with the FEIS’s simplistic use of distance from the pit in areas between the East Pit and the PMP as the only measure of whether a wetland might be affected by drawdown, fails to adequately assess potential wetland effects.",WET,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WET 10
Erin Mittag,"Fourth, also discussed in more detail below, the type of wetland is important to identifying type and difficulty of mitigation needed and may affect whether the effect must, under applicable law, be completely avoided. As the FEIS acknowledges, both state and federal law require that full function of wetlands be mitigated if they cannot be avoided (avoidance is by far preferable and the required first step in analysis and decision-making for projects that will affect all types of wetlands)281 Function includes the hydrology and the plants and wildlife that are dependent upon that hydrology and the characteristics of a particular wetland type, including whether that wetland is ombrotrophic or minerotrophic.282 It also includes placement of the wetland in the landscape and relationship to the habitat and ecosystems within the area. Where a wetland is unique, rare, and/or difficult to restore or mitigate, avoidance is even more important and mitigation ratios must increase.",WET,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"While it may be correct that an EIS does not always require original scientific research, it does require assessment and analysis of the site of the project itself sufficient to adequately characterize the environmental effects. Analysis of the actual site is not original research, it is in fact the very point of environmental review. There is no reason the project proponent and/or its consultants and/or the Co-Lead Agencies cannot access the site and survey potentially-affected wetlands to determine type through soil and plant analysis. The FEIS has been years in the making and this issue in particular was raised by the Conservation Organizations and their experts in comments over twenty months, and two entire growing seasons, prior to the issuance of the FEIS. In particular, MCEA’s original comments on the SDEIS, at 87, criticized the lack of vegetation plots for assessment of wetland types and potential effects. Moreover, when the Conservation Organizations requested access to the site to conduct their own analysis during the 2015 growing season (something that the proponent and co-lead agencies should have done, but that non-profits were willing to do nonetheless), PolyMet denied access to public lands and the Forest Service allowed PolyMet to do so.",WET,S,O,8,Barr 2011d Section 2.1
Erin Mittag,"Finally, the Response to Comments284 complains that a quantitative functional wetlands assessment has not been done because there is not a software program that can accomplish this task for a particular site. While that may be true, it does not then allow the project proponent and co-lead agencies to simply skip the task altogether. The combined effect rises to the level of purposeful, studied ignorance and avoidance of the plain legal requirements of NEPA, MEPA, and C.A.W. § 404. nan",NEPA,S,N,8,"DNR believes the Final EIS appropriately discloses that DNR and the USACE require functions to be replaced consistent with the requirements of Final SDD Section 3.3.3. The Final EIS reports that both agencies use a set of defined ratio requirements to determine the number of acres required to replace functions lost; this is because there is currently no suitable quantitative functional assessment method in Minnesota. Based on the findings and where impacts occur (e.g., types of wetlands), the mitigation ratios and credits have been increased to take into account the functions lost due to the NorthMet Project Proposed Action. For example, additional compensatory mitigation (i.e., a higher replacement ratio) is proposed to offset loss of bog wetlands, a difficult-to-replace wetland type. All of the wetland mitigation proposed would be restored with minimal wetland preservation; no creation of wetlands would be part of the off-site mitigation. Furthermore, as previously noted, the mitigation sites would need to meet performance standards in"
Erin Mittag,The FEIS fails to adequately identify minerotrophic wetlands potentially affected by the project and has plainly made no attempt to do so.,WET,S,N,8,"See Final EIS Section 5.2.3.1.2. Impacts to both minerotrophic and ombrotrophic wetlands were assessed. See PolyMet 2015b, Large Table 10."
Erin Mittag,The Conservation Organizations strongly disagree with the premise in the FEIS that by changing the description of potential indirect effects to “low likelihood” as opposed to no likelihood allows the co-lead agencies to avoid analysis and disclosure of potential for negative effects to wetlands from the project. This shorthand and non-analytical approach is inadequate and misleading.,WET,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WET 08
Erin Mittag,"17.2 Avoidance and mitigation of wetland impacts is required by law but not sufficiently covered or assure in the FEIS. The state and federal requirements for projects that affect wetlands have been set forth in earlier comments and in the FEIS itself and will not be repeated in detail here. Nonetheless, the Conservation Organizations emphasize two important components of wetland preservation and mitigation: the need to wholly avoid impacts to unique and rare natural resources and the need to fully mitigate all functions of any affected wetlands resource. The FEIS fails to provide adequate information and analysis of wetland impacts within those legal requirements and associated mitigation to address these requirements.",NEPA,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WET 20
Erin Mittag,"17.2.1 State and federal law require that effects to rare natural communities must be avoided, but the FEIS does not consider avoidance. The FEIS acknowledges that the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act (“WCA”) requires special consideration for wetlands that are rare natural communities.285 Rare natural communities are native plant communities having conservation rank of S1, S2, or S3, or are communities within an area that has outstanding or high biodiversity significance rating. The FEIS further acknowledges that the entire project area is one of high biodiversity significance and that most of the S2/S3 ecosystem is within the mine site itself or within the direct influence of the mine site activities and effects. More than 50 percent of the Upper Partridge River area of high biodiversity significance will be obliterated by the mine and associated mine features, while a substantial portion of the remaining 50 percent of the high biodiversity significance will be “indirectly” negatively affected by the mine. The FEIS continues, however, to omit any analysis of what this actually means in terms of ecosystem impacts, implications for downstream and surrounding areas and the wildlife and vegetation that is present or depending on these high-quality areas, and fails to address the implications for mitigation. These very questions were originally raised in comments on the SDEIS by Friends and MCEA and remain unaddressed. Plainly, even if the FEIS does not expressly so state, the mine will permanently destroy the rare natural communities identified. The FEIS also fails to address the issue this raises regarding Minn. R. 8420.0515, supb. 3, which provides that mitigation plans must be denied for an activity that involves the modification of a rare natural community if the proposed activity will permanently adversely affect that natural community The foundation for this requirement is plain: rare natural wetlands communities such as those at the PolyMet site, comprised of a large, contiguous assemblage of northern peatland wetlands including coniferous bog (both ombrotrophic and minerotrophic) is impossible to restore or recreate elsewhere. Mitigation of the functions for this wetlands complex is an unworkable and unsupported concept. There is no scientific evidence that it can or has been successfully done. The research strongly cautions against allowing effects to peatland or bog environments because they cannot be rectified. The scientific literature is largely in agreement on this point. As noted by an article authored by EPA and provided on USGS’s website, these types of wetlands “have developed over thousands of years and ...have hydrologic conditions that are difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate,” and that “experts agree” that bog and fen ecosystems are the least likely to be effectively replaced. This is consistent with the report of the National Research Council in 2000 that pointedly stated wetland mitigation to date had been largely a failure, resulting in continuing net loss of wetlands and further emphasizing that bog wetlands in particular do not appear susceptible of restoration or mitigation once harmed. The NRC Report, in surveying the literature, stated wetland types like fens and bogs “cannot be effectively restored with present knowledge”, and recommended avoiding impacts to those resources. In a follow-up article, scientists on the panel stated that the no net loss mitigation program had been in fact fostering a net loss of approximately eighty percent of wetlands. For years, the Corps has followed the advice of the NRC Report that bog and fen-type ecosystems are difficult-to-replace and impacts to them should therefore be avoided. Research published as recently as 2012 continues to demonstrate these problems, finding that restored wetlands, despite real effort (as opposed to the often failed and incomplete efforts allowed by regulatory agencies) still suffer from structural and functional loss of ecosystem function. Despite the requirements for high value and difficult to replace wetlands and ecosystems such as those proposed to be destroyed by PolyMet, and despite the agreement in the science regarding the fallacy of thinking that the destroyed wetlands can be replaced or restored, the FEIS spends no time contemplating, analyzing or discussing these issues and concerns and blithely proposes mitigation business as usual.",NEPA,S,O,11,SDEIS COOP Response #12602
Erin Mittag,"17.2.2 Indirect wetlands effects are not adequately disclosed and analyzed and are defined too narrowly in the FEIS. Both federal and state law are clear that wetland effects that must be avoided and/or mitigated include all direct effects (e.g. where wetlands will be destroyed by the mine pit) and indirect effects—which includes changes in size, type, hydrology, or plant composition of a wetland as well as overall biodiversity and function of the wetland within the larger landscape. Both direct and indirect effects must be mitigated under state and federal law, and the mitigation must replace the full functions lost by virtue of either the direct or the indirect effects.",WET,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"Yet, the FEIS fails to adequately identify and analyze indirect effects and further defines and treats indirect effects very narrowly. The FEIS appears to constrain the definition of indirect effects on wetlands as including only changes in the hydrology of a wetland as a direct result of mine or processing facility activities or by virtue of “fragmentation,” further appearing to narrowly define fragmentation as a diminishment in physical size (i.e. acreage) of a specific individual wetland.297 Even fragmentation is largely regarded through a hydrological lens. These constraints fail to address and disclose all potential impacts to wetlands from the PolyMet project and in turn fail to address the full mitigation obligation primarily by fragmenting the analysis itself on a ‘wetland by wetland’ basis instead of looking at the entire, complex wetland and ecosystem assemblage that is the mine site.",WET,S,O,8,FEIS Section 5.2.3
Erin Mittag,"First, the FEIS fails to adequately disclose and analyze potential indirect effects even within the narrow definitional constraints used. The FEIS simply states there will be a “low likelihood” of indirect effects and leaves the analysis for another day, likely after the mine has already started operation and it is far too late to avoid effects; the damage will occur by the time it is identified as even a possibility. This is unacceptable",WET,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"While the Conservation Organizations acknowledge that the Co-Lead Agencies may be currently unable to identify and analyze all indirect effects to wetlands, they can certainly identify some and begin to assess which are more likely than others.",WET,S,O,8,FEIS Section 5.2.3
Erin Mittag,"For example, DNR acknowledges the validity of the modeling and criticisms from GLIFWC regarding groundwater drawdown and flows in the area between the PolyMet pit and the Northshore mine. The information in the FEIS and supplied by GLIFWC demonstrates groundwater flow in and out of the north side of the PolyMet east pit. The FEIS also acknowledges that the Cat 1 stockpile will have an effect on water flows—even if the operation is as PolyMet intends, indirect effects are likely to occur.300 This is adequate information for the FEIS to provide that some indirect effects are in fact likely to occur and make an estimate of where and what they are. This is particularly important for mitigation as mitigation is required to occur BEFORE the effects do. The co-lead agencies should make every effort to identify potential effects now and protect against them with conservative mitigation measures and ratios, not wait for the damage to occur and then scramble for a solution.",COE,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WET 01
Erin Mittag,"Second, the narrow approach to defining indirect effects fails to conform to the legal requirements for avoiding and/or mitigating all effects to wetlands. Hydrologic changes are of course an important component of indirect effects to wetlands. With respect to hydrologic changes, the FEIS provides that only those hydrologic changes that result in a 20 percent change in watershed area (converting a function—wetland hydrology—to an areal or geographic measure) will be considered an indirect effect.301 It cites solely to a paper by Richter for support of this standard. Upon review, the paper cited does not apply. The Richter paper concerns flow in rivers (and barriers or alterations affecting flow, like dams), an entirely different ecosystem than peatland wetlands. Nothing in the paper suggests it is transferable to any other ecosystem analysis much less peatlands or other wetlands. And it isn’t even addressing “watershed area” the metric with which the FEIS purports to be concerned. Rather the paper is referencing 20 percent reductions in river flow, an entirely different metric. It is specious for the FEIS to cite to this as support for a number that otherwise appears entirely arbitrary for assessing indirect hydrologic effects to wetlands. The co-lead agencies admit that the paper is really only about river flows, but state, with absolutely no explanation, discussion, or support, that they “believe” it provides a foundation for using the 20 percent number here.302 The co-lead agencies’ “belief” finds no support in the science or the law. The law provides that indirect effects must be avoided and if they cannot be avoided mitigated. It does not set a threshold of 20 percent before the requirements take hold. The co-lead agencies are wrong and arbitrary.",NEPA,S,O,8,The Co-lead Agencies’ application of their professional judgment and/or expert opinion was an acceptable practice within the field of environmental review.
Erin Mittag,"Third, the narrow definition tied almost exclusively to hydrologic measures also does not take into account the obvious effects on the overall complex of wetlands and the diminishment of the function of the area known as the Hundred Mile Swamp. As noted previously and as is plain from maps and the Co-Lead Agencies’ own documents and statements, the area of the PolyMet mine site is a very large intact northern wetland complex, including many high-quality natural communities. This area, as a whole, is the headwaters for the Partridge River. This area functions as a whole, not as a group of smaller, isolated wetland and/or upland ecosystems. Therefore, the FEIS treatment of this area as a group of small isolated wetlands each of which can be destroyed or negatively affected without regard to others is scientifically unsupported and unsupported by the agencies’ own previous assessment of the area. The system of assigning a value of 0 to 6 to “assess” risk to each small increment in the system is simply the appearance of an iterative process, but it is in fact a purposefully artificial constraint on assessing the potential risk to this integrated wetlands complex and ecosystem and the need to avoid or mitigate effects to it. The Co-Lead Agencies make the classic error of slicing and dicing an integrated ecosystem in order to minimize negative effects and to effectively deny their consequences. This is an illegal segmentation of NEPA analysis.",WET,S,N,8,"Under NEPA segmentation applies to a project, not ecosystems."
Erin Mittag,"The law demands that the function of the entire affected system be taken into consideration in the avoidance and mitigation analysis and requirements. In particular, the FEIS fails to address the effect of taking the larger intact northern peatland and forest assemblage and reducing it to a narrow strip of property, likely with changed hydrology and dust deposition, between two huge mines—PolyMet and Northshore. The entirety of the area, particularly the entirety of the area between these two mines, must be considered indirectly affected with respect to a functions analysis and addressed in the avoidance and mitigation components of the FEIS regardless of hydrological effects determined by after-the-fact spot checking in isolated locations.303 The FEIS fails to analyze and discuss the functions of the large intact assemblage (the interaction and value of a complex mix of forest and wetland, within a headwaters; the role of the plant and wildlife mix and connectedness of the system) and fails to analyze and discuss the effect of eliminating the large intact assemblage, leaving in its place a very small and likely altered remnant. Instead, the FEIS treats each small individual wetland as an isolated ecosystem, an approach wholly unsupported by science or the facts. Finally, the FEIS fails to propose mitigation for these obvious effects. The entirety of the hundred mile swamp complex should be considered indirectly affected due to its large reduction in overall size and should be mitigated (if the project is allowed to proceed as proposed) as its function will plainly be lost.",NEPA,S,O,6,Addressing ecosystem services was not scoped into the EIS and is not required. No supporting analysis offered.
Erin Mittag,"17.2.3 The FEIS inadequately addresses climate change implications for wetland impact avoidance and mitigation. Climate change and its effect on northern wetlands is also inadequately addressed in the FEIS. The FEIS is lacking in this regard in two ways. First, the FEIS fails to adequately identify and analyze the effect that climate change will have on the northern peatlands landscape and how that should shape the avoidance component of wetlands regulation and/or the mitigation requirement. Nowhere in the wetlands section is climate change mentioned. Only in the Response to Comments on wetlands does the document claim a “qualitative assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on wetlands is included in FEIS Section 5.2.7.2.4.”304 Section 5.2.7.2.4 follows on the air quality section, not an obvious placement for wetland impacts. More to the point, Section 5.2.7.2.4 contains little to no assessment of climate impacts on wetlands, much less a “qualitative assessment” stating only that climate change may affect some wetlands in some ways. It then references Barr 2012l. Barr 2012l can be summarized as stating climate change may make some wetlands wetter, some drier, some hotter, some shadier and that increased temperatures may release more methane. The total amount of text devoted to the topic is no more than a page and can hardly be described as a qualitative assessment of what is actually going to occur with wetlands on the site and more importantly contains no discussion of what the may mean regarding impacts from the project and need for and location of mitigation. A quick search of even a single piece of local research would have produced more detailed information. Recent research suggests that Minnesota boreal peatlands may suffer most from the effects of climate change. Most vulnerable will be the southern extent of those lands---the very areas where PolyMet proposes two of the three mitigation sites. Coupled with the science on how questionable mitigation for peatlands is, it is plain that the agencies must consider avoidance of effects to the PolyMet wetlands as an important hedge against the effects of climate change. Maintaining intact ecosystems is plainly identified as the preferable path in the face of climate threats. In light of the science, the FEIS must discuss how eliminating a vast area of high-quality and intact wetland will affect overall system resiliency in the face of climate change. At a minimum, the FEIS must analyze and discuss how climate change may affect the success of the proposed mitigation and whether or to what extent the mitigation proposal may have to adjust in light of climate effects, whether in terms of location, overall size, watershed, and/or ratios.",WET,S,O,8,Assessing potential project-related climate change implications is not a requirement of the Final Scope. Assessment of project-related peatland losses in the context of global climate change is beyond the scope of the EIS.
Erin Mittag,"Second, the FEIS at best is confused on the issue of carbon sequestration and at worst is misleading. The science is undisputed that the best carbon sinks on the planet are peatlands. Globally, peatlands represent just 3 percent of all soils but contain more than one-third of all soil organic Carbon. A preliminary inventory of peatlands in Minnesota estimates that the 5.73 million acres of peatland in the state contain 4,250 megatonnes (million metric tons) of C, or approximately 745 metric tons of stored C per acre. Moreover, drying of peatlands from water drawdown increases emissions of both carbon and methane, creating a feedback loop and increasing fire risk—another source of carbon emissions.",AIR,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"The Response to Comments, while acknowledging the loss of carbon sequestration, claims that restoration elsewhere will compensate.311 This statement comes with no support. There is no independent science to support the claim that the carbon sequestration benefits of the mixed, old peatlands at the PolyMet site will be mitigated with wetlands at any of the three mitigation sites (especially since two of them are south of the project site and don’t propose to replace coniferous bog habitat.). Also, even if some mitigation occurs, there is no mitigation for the very big one-time release of the destruction event itself, much less the over-time release that is bound to happen from some indirect effects over time. There is no discussion in the FEIS of the loss of sequestration, or the effects of that loss on the environment. The published research makes clear that avoiding impacts to peatlands is the only way to ensure that they continue their function as a carbon sink and serve as a refuge from future climate change impacts.",AIR,S,O,6,SDEIS COOP Response #17903
Erin Mittag,"17.2.4 The FEIS fails to explain how the proposed mitigation complies with the law. As stated above, state and federal law requires mitigation for lost or degraded wetland functions when those effects cannot first be avoided. PolyMet currently proposes to mitigate only direct impacts to site wetlands and proposes to mitigate the majority of those negative effects outside of the Lake Superior watershed. The only explanation for why the Co-Lead Agencies believe this is acceptable is because mitigation sites were “difficult to find” within the watershed. This runs counter to the Friends’ and MCEA’s own expert analysis312 and the FEIS fails to provide adequate detail for the public to understand and judge whether rejection of certain sites was proper. Further, even if it is true that there are no acceptable mitigation sites within the watershed, there is nothing in the law that then excuses PolyMet from application of the avoid and mitigate requirements. If the impacts cannot be avoided, they must be mitigated. If they cannot be mitigated they cannot be allowed. The Co-Lead Agencies’ position in the FEIS appears to be that the law is only a strong suggestion or guidance, to be complied with if to do so is relatively easy. This approach would render the law meaningless and that is outside the Co-Lead Agencies’ authority. The apparent lack of mitigation opportunities within the watershed further raises questions with respect to PolyMet and the Co- Lead Agencies’ failure to address expected indirect impacts (discussed above) now, before the impact occurs. Again, that is not compliant with the temporal requirements for mitigation in the law and the FEIS provides no explanation for how the Co-Lead Agencies think it might be. Further, it highlights the fact that mitigating for likely future indirect impacts will be difficult within the bounds of the law. If the Co-Lead Agencies properly require mitigation for the entirety of indirect effects to the Hundred Mile Swamp functions and for expected indirect effects given what is already known about flow between PolyMet’s east pit and Northshore, thousands more acres of wetland must be mitigated. If the Co-Lead Agencies already know that mitigation sites are severely limited, moving forward and allowing impacts nonetheless is irresponsible and not compliant with the law. As MCEA states in the SDEIS comments, thousands of acres of wetlands may be affected with no potential mitigation option identified much less provided before the effects occur. In addition to the out-of-watershed and temporal violations inherent in the current approach, the FEIS pays lip service to mitigating functions lost, but it provides no real discussion of how PolyMet will in fact “mitigate” or “restore” coniferous bog wetlands, and in particular how PolyMet will recreate a groundwater-fed fen. The suggestion of as much borders on ridiculous. The scientific literature is replete with statements about how it is nearly impossible to mitigate bogs, how it has rarely (if ever, depending on how success is defined) been done successfully, and that therefore, damage to these wetland types should always be avoided. The Conservation Organizations are unaware of any example of a fen being mitigated. And the FEIS appears to recognize this when it continues to talk about “targets” for mitigation314 admitting that if the coniferous bog and swamp restoration is unsuccessful then targets will simply be readjusted to be whatever PolyMet actually comes up with in the mitigation effort. The so-called targets concept does not comply with the law’s requirement to fully replace lost functions and is in fact more of a “moving target” for mitigation. Finally, given the out-of-watershed proposal and obvious difficulty with actually mitigating the functions that will be destroyed within a timeframe wherein those functions will actually be replaced, the FEIS provides a somewhat incoherent discussion of mitigation ratios. At some level the FEIS provides for 2:1 but then engages in lengthy speculation regarding reducing those ratios to 1:1. The charts showing mitigation acres actually show that coniferous bog will not be mitigation on a 1:1 basis; it appears that PolyMet will rely on coniferous swamp at their Aitkin site for some of those acres, a failure to meet the mitigation requirements of replacing full function. The Co-Lead Agencies must require 2:1 as the minimum replacement ratio for all wetland effects from the PolyMet project. There is no scientific, legal, or factual support for anything less.",PER,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme WET 03
Erin Mittag,"17.3 The FEIS fails to address increased potential for mercury methylation in area wetlands. As the FEIS recognizes, the mine and ore transport facilities will result in airborne particulates and deposition of those particulates in area wetlands.315 While the FEIS provides some information regarding inhibited photosynthesis and the response to comments provides some discussion of sulfate and some other metals running off (largely discounting any potential effect) the response to comments in the FEIS wholly fail to answer the comments that raised potential for increased mercury methylation from the deposition of sulfates and mercury in ore and rock dust.316 The FEIS acknowledges the research, much of it from Minnesota, that demonstrates sulfates and mercury deposition in peat environments is a synergistic combination. Sulfates hastens the methylation of mercury in the peat environment making the mercury bioavailable. While comments on the SDEIS raised this issue and asked for analysis of how deposition from the PolyMet project will affect mercury methylation in area wetlands, the FEIS failed to include this analysis and the response to comments wholly dodges the question.317 The only response claims that mercury that will be deposited from dust and spillage is within the variability of background.318 This doesn’t address the direct question of what effect increased mercury and sulfate, acting synergistically, may have on methylation of mercury in the subject wetlands.",NEPA,S,O,8,The re-evaluation indicates the estimated potential incremental increase in sulfate and metals from the deposition of the Project's fugitive dust emissions is expected to be within the variability of background concentrations and is not expected to have a measurable or significant effect on water quality.

Erin Mittag,"17.4.1 Assurance for monitoring for indirect effects. The FEIS defers the issue of indirect effects and claims that indirect wetland effects will not be mitigated prior to commencement of the mining project. Rather, the FEIS provides that wetlands that have the most probability of impacts (a questionable concept in itself, see discussion above) will be monitored and if indirect effects occur, they will be identified and mitigated. Putting aside the issue of whether this is an acceptable approach to indirect effects as a whole, there remains a serious issue regarding financial assurance to ensure the monitoring will occur at a frequency and adequate number of locations, and for a sufficient period of time after mine closure. The project proponents and the Co-Lead Agencies should disclose the cost of the proposed monitoring given that they know where they intend to place monitors (with their purported ratings approach) and they know how much monitors cost. The costs of monitoring should be extended for the period of time after mining ceases that effects are expected—at least for a length of time after the East Pit fills given the modeling showing movement of water between the East Pit and Northshore and the possibility of flows northward. This is an knowable cost estimate that should be provided to the public.",FIN,S,N,8,SDEIS Theme FIN 11

Information regarding the costs associated with acquisition of those sites, either directly or through leasing or purchase of easements, is known. Also known are the bulk of activities necessary to restore those sites as demonstrated by the discussions of hydrology restoration, planting, and monitoring set forth in the FEIS. For example, PolyMet and/or the Co- Lead Agencies are fully capable of estimating labor costs, time, equipment necessary to the job and costs of seedlings to arrive at an estimate. Again, those are known quantities with known and knowable costs whereby an estimate can readily be provided. The mitigation sites will also require their own monitoring, another cost estimate that must be provided and that can be readily known with information available now. This information would also allow an estimate for the public for future mitigation needs for indirect wetland effects. It is critical that PolyMet be required to set aside funds should indirect effects need to be mitigated at some point in the future.

Erin Mittag,"The FEIS must include the off-site “indirect” impacts of this project. CEQ Regulations state that an EIS must include a consideration of “any adverse environmental effects,” including both direct and indirect effects. Indirect effects are those which are “caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable.” A “reasonably foreseeable” effect is defined as one which “is sufficiently likely to occur that a person of ordinary prudence would take it into account.” Federal courts have held that this includes “downstream” impacts such as the impacts of burning coal after it has been shipped on a new rail line. The Eighth Circuit applied these definitions to a proposal to construct new rail lines to the Powder River Coal Basin in Wyoming. Since those rail lines would increase availability of the coal and decrease its price, the Court held that increased coal consumption was a reasonably foreseeable effect of the proposal, such that its environmental impact must be included in the EIS.",CUM,S,O,3,FEIS Section 6.1.1
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS does not assess the indirect impacts of burning coal due to its energy demand from Minnesota Power facilities. According to Minnesota Power’s most recent Integrated Resource Plan, at present, Minnesota Power’s resource mix includes 75 percent coal-burning power plants. The utility owns two coal-fired power plants, Boswell Energy Center (4 units, 926 MW total) and Taconite Harbor Energy Center (2 units, 150 MW total). Minnesota Power also has a long-term power purchase from the Square Butte Cooperative's coal-fired Milton Young Plant in North Dakota (currently, 100 MW, which purchase MP plans to phase out by 2026). These coal-fired power plants emit over 8 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. The plants emit about 325 lbs of per year of mercury, 7,500 tons per year of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 7,500 tons per year of sulfur dioxide (SO2). PolyMet will cause an incremental increase in the emissions of these pollutants. 326 Although Minnesota Power expects coal to drop to 33 percent of its resource mix, the timing for this estimate is uncertain. In addition, they will be adding natural gas to the mix, their resources will be less carbon intensive, but certainly not carbon- free. Importantly, large industrial customers heavily influence Minnesota Power’s resource planning: In 2014, 54 percent of Minnesota Power’s kilowatt-hour (“kwh”) sales served large power customers, primarily in the taconite mining, iron concentrate, paper, pulp, refining and pipeline industries...Two additional large power customers expected to be operating soon will also be receiving energy from Minnesota Power: PolyMet, a nonferrous mining operation awaiting final permitting, and Essar Steel Minnesota, a major taconite mine and processing plant now under construction. PolyMet is a sufficiently significant customer that it is mentioned by name in the most recent Integrated Resource Plan.

The FEIS calls for disposing of these waste streams at either an “offsite” location or at the Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility. Important information is missing in the FEIS about what the contents of these wastes are expected to be, as well as how to ensure the safe transport and containment of them. Whether or not the waste streams meet the legal definition of “hazardous,” it is likely that they will be voluminous and toxic.

Erin Mittag,"The FEIS fails to take a “hard look” at the environmental effects of transporting ore to smelters, smelting or further processing of the copper ore. The increased copper smelting caused by the removal of copper ore at the PolyMet mine is a reasonably foreseeable impact that should be addressed in the SDEIS. The chain of causation between the extraction of ore at the proposed site and the smelting of the resulting product is much less attenuated than the connection between the construction of new rail lines and coal consumption analyzed by the Eighth Circuit. Copper smelting is clearly certain to occur; for without it the copper precipitate is worthless as an industrial commodity. The FEIS states that the “NorthMet Project Proposed Action would utilize a beneficiation and hydrometallurgical processing technology rather than smelting. Copper smelting at a specific location is not a reasonably foreseeable effect of the NorthMet Project Proposed Action.” It also states that “The off-site transport and use of the metal concentrates is outside the scope of the FEIS.” This response does not meet the requirements of NEPA, as described above. The Hydrometallurgical Facility may replace smelting if it is effective, but it will not become operational for 2-4 years after the beneficiation plant is operational. In the meantime, the copper concentrate produced from the beneficiation process must be smelted. Moreover, the FEIS states that the hydrometallurgical processing technology “would process nickel concentrates.” Based on the FEIS, the Hydrometallurgical Facility is designed to process nickel concentrate, not copper concentrate. A plain reading of Figure 3.2-26 shows that only nickel concentrate enters the autoclave, and copper concentrate must leave the site for further processing, even after the hydrometallurgical facility is built, contradicting the statement cited above from Appendix A that the hydrometallurgical facility replaces copper smelting. As detailed in MCEA comments in 2014, simply because the Co-Lead Agencies do not know the precise location of the copper smelting does not excuse them from analyzing the impacts under NEPA. An indeterminate location of environmental impacts does not affect their inclusion or exclusion in an EIS. In Mid States Coalition for Progress, for example, the court rejected defendant’s argument that increased coal consumption was speculative because specific coal plants that would be built to burn the new coal had not been identified. For NEPA purposes, the court held, it is the nature of the impact that is important. It is certain that some entity will smelt the copper, even if the exact geographic location is still undetermined. CEQ regulations specifically address indirect impacts where there is incomplete or unavailable information. The agency should evaluate those impacts to the extent possible, and include a statement of incompleteness. Even if the environmental impacts of the copper smelting are primarily borne by Canada, those extraterritorial effects do not bar their consideration under NEPA. The federal courts note that “NEPA requires agencies to consider reasonably foreseeable transboundary effects resulting from a major federal action taken within the United States.” This would include any transboundary effects from copper smelting taking place outside U.S. jurisdiction. Moreover, the fact that the location of the smelting is unknown may be the result of willful ignorance, rather than a lack of available information. According to Polymet’s NI 43-101, in the first phase of the NorthMet operation (prior to the construction of the on-site hydrometallurgical facility) the copper and nickel concentrates will be sold to Glencore International “under a long-term marketing agreement.” After the second phase processing facility is built, Polymet will also sell the nickel-cobalt hydroxide and precious metals precipitate produced by that facility to Glencore. In fact, the 2008 long-term marketing agreement specifies that Glencore will purchase “all of Polymet’s products (metals, concentrates or intermediate products) on independent commercial terms at the time of the sale. Glencore will take possession of the products at site and be responsible for transportation and ultimate sale.” After publication of the NI 43-101, Glencore International merged with Xstrata PLC to become Glencore Xstrata PLC.Glencore Xstrata owns a copper smelting operation in Sudbury, Ontario called Sudbury Integrated Nickel Operations, with the capacity to smelt 95,000 tons of nickel and copper concentrates, and the Horne Smelter in Quebec, Canada, which produced 194,000 tons of copper anodes in 2012.341 Therefore, the best approach is for the Co-Lead Agencies to simply ask Glencore where it intends to process the materials. If there is a sound and supported reason why Glencore cannot specify the location of smelting, then it does not excuse the Co-Lead Agencies from analyzing the impacts, but it does allow them to analyze the impacts of smelting at a more general level, along with a statement as to what information is incomplete or unavailable consistent with Minn. R. 4410.2500 and If Glencore can specify the likely location where some or all of the ore would be smelted, than the EIS must analyze those location-specific impacts. MCEA’s SDEIS comments describe some of those impacts on pages 100-105, providing a helpful description of the type of impacts from smelting that must be considered. In addition, the FEIS should analyze the potential impacts of additional transportation of the copper and nickel concentrates to smelters. The FEIS discusses transportation of hazardous materials – primarily diesel fuel and PAX – but does not discuss transportation of the final product. The FEIS should address potential transportation modes (rail, truck, freighter) as well as potential routes over land and water. The transportation of ore may generate air pollution, among other risks. The impacts associated with the transport of ore are “prime examples of indirect effects that NEPA requires be considered. ""While the Conservation Organizations acknowledge that there is some uncertainty as to the final destination of the processed material, the final products will be the property of Glencore by contract, and an inquiry of Glencore as to the likely destination should be part of the analysis. Moreover, Glencore owns other mining assets in North America, as well as smelting facilities. Glencore also owns warehousing and port facilities in North America. Glencore advertises that “we have a sizeable custom smelting and refining capacity.” Glencore’s vertical integration of shipping and processing narrows down the potential routes and destinations considerably. At a minimum, where information about a potential environmental impact is incomplete and cannot be obtained, the RGU must include, by law, the following information in the EIS: A. A statement that the information is incomplete or unavailable and a brief explanation of why it is lacking; B. An explanation of the relevance of the lacking information to evaluation of potentially significant environmental impacts and their mitigation and to a reasoned choice among alternatives; C. A brief summary of existing credible scientific evidence that is relevant to evaluating the potential significant environmental impacts; and D. The RGU’s evaluation of such impacts from the project and its alternatives based upon theoretical approaches or research methods generally accepted in the scientific community. Copper ore contains, obviously, copper, which is toxic to aquatic life, but also [arsenic, cadmium, selenium and other toxic heavy metals discussed in Section 15.2.6, above.

Erin Mittag,"The ESA represents “the most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation.” Congress enacted this statute “to halt and reverse the trend towards species extinction, whatever the cost.” In enacting the ESA, Congress spoke “in the plainest of words, making it abundantly clear that the balance has been struck in affording endangered species the highest of priorities, thereby adopting a policy which it described as ‘institutionalized caution.’” As the court in Tennessee Valley Authority observed: One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in [Section] 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies ‘to insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence’ of an endangered species or ‘result in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species...’ This language admits of no exception. Section 7 of the ESA mandates that “federal agencies take no action that will result in the ‘destruction or adverse modification’ of designated critical habitat.” “Destruction or adverse modification” of critical habitat is defined as “a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of the critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.” The courts have found that this regulatory definition reads the “recovery” goal out of the statutory adverse modification inquiry, “and that agencies must in fact consider impacts that appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat for either survival or recovery. ""Thus, the agencies’ assessment of the impacts of a proposed action on a listed species’ critical habitat must address the project’s potential impact on the species’ habitat in terms of the species’ recovery as well as its survival. In addition, agencies are not allowed to characterize as “insignificant” the potential impacts on a species’ critical habitat by considering only the broad scale or long-term impacts. The NorthMet Mine Site is within designated critical habitat for the Canada lynx and gray wolf, and signs of lynx and wolves have been observed near and at the Mine Site. The proposed mine would reduce suitable habitat for lynx and wolves, and fragment their remaining habitat. Significantly, the proposed mine would destroy two square miles (1454 acres) of critical habitat for lynx and wolves for at least 40 years.363 Moreover, the mine would further affect lynx and wolf critical habitat through impacts to two of the remaining wildlife corridors in this region. Because the proposed mine would result in the destruction and adverse modification of critical habitat for both the Canada lynx and gray wolf, the project violates Section 7 of the ESA and cannot proceed. In addition to the direct impacts on lynx and wolf habitat at the Mine Site, an average of 2066 miles per day of vehicular traffic is expected within the site, with an additional 1734 miles of traffic each day between the Mine Site and Plant Site. This does not include additional highway traffic from workers driving to and from work, or truck traffic delivering supplies. The agencies acknowledge that increased vehicle and train traffic could further affect lynx and wolves, including through vehicle collisions.",WI,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"The consideration and disclosure of cumulative impacts to lynx and wolves in the FEIS is also inadequate, including the cumulative impacts to the few remaining travel corridors in the region. There have been two studies of the few remaining wildlife corridors through the Mesabi Iron Range and Arrowhead Region. In 2006, Emmons and Olivier Resources prepared for the DNR, “Cumulative Effects Analysis on Wildlife Habitat Loss/Fragmentation and Wildlife Travel Corridor Obstruction/Landscape Barriers in the Mesabi Iron Range and Arrowhead Regions of Minnesota.”368 As stated by Emmons & Olivier, wildlife travel through this region is restricted “because of the extensive change to the landscape, including large mine pits, stockpiles, mining infrastructure, regional development associated with the Mesabi Iron Range, and highways.”369 Emmons & Olivier identified only thirteen remaining wildlife corridors across the 100 mile Mesabi Iron Range.370 Moreover, Emmons & Olivier found that any future losses of these relatively small remaining corridors may be considered significant.371 Additionally, due to cumulative effects of past habitat losses in this region for “mammalian species of greatest conservation need,” Emmons & Olivier determined that “any future losses to the habitat requirements for these species could be considered significant.”372 The second study is entitled, “Cumulative Effects Analysis of Wildlife Habitat and Threatened and Endangered Wildlife Species, Keetac Expansion Project,” prepared by Barr Engineering in 2009.373 The Barr Report states that mining features already cover 118,314 acres along the Iron Range, including 36,962 acres of open pit mines, 78,620 acres of stockpiles and tailings basins, and 212 acres of facilities and infrastructure.374 The cumulative impacts of 125 years of mining in this region has fragmented habitat and resulted in a loss of wildlife travel corridors.375 “It is feasible that in the future, mining in the Iron Range could potentially culminate in a 100-mile long landscape barrier that severs wildlife travel corridors, which may have impacts on dispersal, migration, and/or seasonal movements of many species.”376 The Barr Report identified eighteen remaining wildlife corridors.377 Of the eighteen, the Barr Report predicts that “four will likely become completely impassable within the next 25-30 years as a result of planned mining activities,” and an additional four corridors “will retain some functionality, but will be significantly degraded by future mining plans.”378 In addition, “[a]s wildlife are increasingly exposed to mining activity, roads, and urban centers due to the degradation of available corridors, the incidence of wildlife mortality within the corridors is likely to increase.”379 Due to insufficient data, however, the Barr Report was unable to determine whether wide-ranging mammals such as lynx and wolves would be “sensitive” to these cumulative effects.380 As briefly summarized in the FEIS, there are thirteen wildlife travel corridors that remain along the Mesabi Iron Range, ranging from less than 0.1 mile to over 3.2 miles wide.381 “Of the 13 large mammal wildlife crossing corridors . . . two are in the vicinity of the Mine Site or Plant Site.”382 The first is located just a mile from the Plant Site, and the second is located just a half mile from the proposed Mine Site.383 “Operations at the Mine Site would indirectly affect the corridor by reducing its size and acting as a source of noise and activity near the large habitat block southeast of the corridor.”384 Additionally, the proposed mine’s transportation and utility corridor between the Mine Site and Plant Site runs parallel to wildlife corridors and would further affect wildlife use.385 Moreover, other reasonably foreseeable projects are anticipated to adversely affect the remaining wildlife travel corridors in the region, including the complete loss of some of the corridors.386 “These effects may include blocking or encroachment into the mapped wildlife corridors, which affects adjacent habitat that may make the corridor less valuable to wildlife, and increasing traffic along new or existing roads through the corridor.387 “The effects on these corridors include complete loss (depending upon final extent of activities), habitat isolation, fragmentation, and/or minimal effect.”",WI,NS,X,1,

Erin Mittag,"The EIS must disclose the ongoing, acute decline in the moose population, the position of the mine site on the edge of what is now considered moose territory, and the impact of this loss of habitat. The EIS fails to provide the “hard look” at impacts on moose that is required by NEPA. This issue was raised on our comments on the SDEIS.393 Our SDEIS comments are attached to this objection letter, and the referenced pages along with all cited materials are incorporated herein. This issue was not addressed in the FEIS Response to Comments. Although the FEIS has added a small amount of information on moose, it neither includes the factors that we raised in our comments nor explains why they are not included, in violation of 40 C.F.R. § 1503.4(a) (agency must consider and respond to comments) and 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(b) (agency must discuss in FEIS “any responsible opposing view,” and “shall indicate the agency’s response to the issues raised”). For instance, the FEIS fails to assess the project’s impact on moose due to vehicle and train collisions and the increase in noise and human activity, which were raised in our comments on the SDEIS and supported by scientific literature. The FEIS discloses that 2,785.9 acres of moose habitat would be directly affected by the project, but fails to discuss either indirect impacts on habitat or the actual effects on moose.394 This includes significant impacts to high quality wetlands, which habitat is particularly important to moose due to ongoing and future climate change. In fact, the 2009 Report to the DNR by the Minnesota Moose Advisory Committee recommended the enhancement of the availability of “wetlands and other habitats where moose are most secure from heat stress.”395 The impacts of the proposed mine on heat stress and thermal refugia for moose, however, are not considered or disclosed. More generally, the FEIS fails to assess the impacts to moose and other species dependent on wetland habitat in the context of the current and anticipated impacts of climate change, which will cause the disappearance of wetlands, higher temperatures, increased evapotranspiration, and longer droughts over the same time period of the proposed mine and its impacts.396",WI,S,O,8,FEIS pgs. 5-568 to 5-569
Erin Mittag,"As recognized by the CEQ, “[c]limate change is a fundamental environmental issue, and the relation of Federal actions to it falls squarely within NEPA’s focus.”397 Agencies must consider not only a proposed action’s effects on climate change, but also “the implications of climate change for the environmental effects of a proposed action.”398 “Federal agencies, to remain consistent with NEPA, should . . . take into account the ways in which a changing climate over the life of the proposed project may alter the overall environmental implications of such actions.”399 The impacts of climate change are already occurring, are predicted to intensify, and are directly related to the environmental consequences of the proposed NorthMet mine on the state’s sensitive and declining moose population. As recognized by the Moose Advisory Committee, climate change is a long-term threat to the persistence of moose in Minnesota.400 Moreover, “large bodied mammals, such as moose [a]re more likely to rapidly respond to climate change, which indicates a higher extinction risk.”401 As a result of climate change, “[m]oose will lose crucial habitat, experience heat stress and malnutrition, and come into contact with more pathogens and winter ticks as a result of warmer, wetter winters and springs, a reduction in show depth, and hotter summers.”402 Moreover, boreal species on which moose rely are expected to decline, “and forested wetlands – an incredibly valuable type of habitat for moose – will likely disappear.”403 The adverse impacts of losing over 2,700 acres of important moose habitat as result of the proposed mine simply cannot be considered in isolation of the significant, recognized threats to moose and its habitat in the region resulting from current and predicted climate change. Furthermore, NEPA does not allow the agencies to not address in the FEIS the combined impacts of climate change and the proposed mine on moose just because the exact rate and extent of climate change remains uncertain. NEPA instead requires agencies to engage in reasonable forecasting when preparing EISs, as speculation is implicit in NEPA.404 As stated by the Eighth Circuit, “when the nature of the effect is reasonably foreseeable but its extent is not, . . . the agency may not simply ignore the effect.405 Moreover, as recognized by CEQ, agencies should describe the region that would be affected by a proposal “based on available climate change information, including observations, interpretative assessments, predictive modeling, scenarios, and other empirical evidence.”406 And despite remaining uncertainties, CEQ emphasized that a NEPA analysis “should present a reasonably thorough discussion of probable environmental consequences.”407 The agencies’ failure to consider the implications and impacts of climate change along with the proposed NorthMet mine project on the declining moose population is especially egregious due to the very long-term duration of the proposed mine, and its severe impacts on wetlands and other habitat needs of moose. As highlighted by CEQ, “climate change effects should be considered in the analysis of projects that are designed for long-term utility and involve resources considered vulnerable to specific effects of climate change within the timeframe of the proposed project’s anticipated useful life.”408 Overall, the agencies failure to consider and disclose in the FEIS the combined impacts of climate change and the proposed mine on moose habitat and the remaining declining population violates NEPA.",WI,S,O,8,FEIS Sections 4.2.5.1.1 and 5.2.5.2.2 discuss the additive effect of climate change on moose.
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS also fails to inform the reader of the actual situation regarding moose in Minnesota and the potential impact of this and other projects on moose recovery in the Midwestern United States. Much of this information is provided in a petition to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for federal Endangered Species Act listing of alces alces andersoni, the subspecies of moose found in the Midwest.410 In addition, we are including the report from the MDNR’s 2015 aerial moose survey.411 These documents are in addition to the material submitted with comments to the SDEIS, which are again included with this submission.",WI,S,O,8,FEIS App. D pg. 6-85
Erin Mittag,"Moose, which have been observed in the project area,412 are listed by the state as a species of special concern.413 The DNR and Forest Service have been well aware for years that the moose population in the state and on the Superior National Forest is in precipitous decline, a fact that cannot be discerned from the NorthMet FEIS. The FEIS discussion of this issue is a classic example of providing only data that tends to discount the problem in the eye of the reader. What the FEIS tells us is: The overall moose population declined approximately 35 percent from 2012 to 2013. The 2014 winter aerial moose survey estimated the population at 4,350 animals, up from the 2013 estimate of 2,760. However, this is likely due to variability in the survey conditions from year to year and uncertainty inherent in the survey itself. 414 The reader is left with the idea that perhaps the 35 percent change from 2012 to 2013 was an anomaly due to counting methods, and with no understanding as to the actual situation. According to the MDNR, the population estimate for moose in the state was 8,840 in 2006, and in 2015 is estimated at 3,450.415 While the count did go up in 2014, the trend over a ten-year period is a decline of more than 60 percent. The FEIS also fails to recognize the critical importance of northeastern Minnesota for the remaining moose population in the state. Moose also used to be common in northwestern Minnesota, but that population has disappeared over the last twenty years. From a population of 4,000, fewer than 100 remain, with any rebound seen as very unlikely. This leaves northeastern Minnesota, including the Proposed Project area, as the only remaining refuge for the state’s declining moose population. To summarize, the Minnesota moose population is undergoing a rapid decline and may be extirpated from the state of Minnesota within another decade; habitat loss and fragmentation is acknowledged to be a factor in that decline; it is acknowledged that this project will result in a loss of habitat; and with no further information, the FEIS concludes that the project would likely not affect moose at the population level. NEPA prohibits agencies from making such sweeping general statements without providing supporting data or analysis.416 As noted below, the FEIS analysis of the potential impacts to moose is even more deficient and problematic in the cumulative impacts analysis, where moose are not even mentioned. Overall, the FEIS has failed to meaningfully consider and disclose the impacts of the proposed mine on the state’s dramatically declining moose population. The omission of any meaningful consideration of such an important issue “precludes the type of informed decision making mandated by NEPA.”",WI,S,O,8,"FEIS Section 5.3.5.2.2, pg. 4-237"
Erin Mittag,"The Cumulative Effects Analysis in the FEIS is Inadequate. NEPA and MEPA both require an analysis of the potential cumulative impacts of a proposed action.418 The NEPA regulations provide the following definition for cumulative impacts: Cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.419 In order to properly consider cumulative effects in an EIS, NEPA requires quantified and detailed information.420 “Without such information, neither the courts nor the public, in reviewing the [agency’s] decisions, can be assured that the [agency] provided the hard look that it is required to provide.”421 “General statements about ‘possible’ effects and ‘some risk’ do not constitute a ‘hard look’ absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.”422 “Nor is it appropriate to defer consideration of cumulative impacts to a future date,”423 as NEPA requires consideration of the potential impact of an action before the action takes place.424 As explained throughout these comments, the FEIS cumulative impacts analysis for a number of resources – including but not limited to water quality, wetlands, and wildlife - is inadequate and fails to comply with NEPA or MEPA. The FEIS provides only general, mostly non-quantified analysis, which falls far short of the detail required. In Great Basin Mine Watch v. Hankins, 456 F.3d 955, 971-974 (9th Cir. 2006), the court struck down an agency’s reliance on generalized descriptions of mining impacts in a region, and instead required the agency to include “mine-specific ... cumulative data.”425 The court highlighted the need for a “quantified assessment of [other projects’] combined environmental impacts” and an “objective quantification of the impacts.”426 The FEIS for the proposed PolyMet mine fails to provide this necessary analysis.",NEPA,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"In addition to providing primarily general, non-quantified analysis, the FEIS makes a number of fundamental mistakes in its cumulative impacts analysis. The FEIS, for instance, in its assessment of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions, the agencies failed to include the hundreds of exploratory drilling projects taking place in the same region on federal, state, and private lands.427 The fact that these exploratory drilling projects will collectively contribute towards significant cumulative impacts on a number of resources is acknowledged by the Forest Service in the forest-wide EIS that it prepared for only a subset of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects.",CUM,S,N,12,The Final SDD did not identify exploratory drilling activity as a reasonably foreseeable action for consideration in cumulative effects analysis. DNR did not receive comments on the Draft EIS or Supplemental Draft EIS requesting consideration of this activity in the cumulative effects analysis. The issue is beyond the scope of the EIS.
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS also limited its consideration of reasonably foreseeable future actions to only those that are included in approved planning documents and have approved funding, are permitted, or have a currently active federal or state permit or site plan application under review. 428 This definition of reasonably foreseeable actions is unreasonably narrow and violates NEPA. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has more broadly held that an environmental effect is reasonably foreseeable under NEPA if it sufficiently likely to occur that a person of ordinary prudence would take it into account in reaching a decision.429 Moreover, “when the nature of the effect is reasonably foreseeable but its extent is not, . . . the agency may not simply ignore the effect.”430 The lead agencies claim that they relied on 1997 CEQ and 1999 EPA guidance in preparing the cumulative impacts analysis.431 The CEQ guidance, however, demonstrates that the approach taken by the agencies in the FEIS is impermissibly narrow and violates NEPA. As explained by CEQ: Commonly, analysts only include those plans for actions which are funded or for which other NEPA analysis is being prepared. This approach does not meet the letter or intent of CEQ’s regulations. It underestimates the number of future projects, because many viable actions may be in the early planning stage. 432 Agency must instead “use the best available information to develop scenarios that predict which future actions might reasonably be expected as a result of the proposal.”433 Similarly, “[i]f the analyst is uncertain whether to include future actions, it may be appropriate to bound the problem by developing several scenarios with different assumptions about future actions.”434 Future actions can only be excluded from the cumulative impacts analysis if the action is outside the established geographic boundaries or time frame, the action would not affect any resources, or the agency can show that including the action would be arbitrary.435 Importantly, CEQ makes clear that “reasonable forecasting is implicit in NEPA,” and therefore “it is the responsibility of federal agencies to predict the environmental effects of proposed actions before they are fully known.”436 EPA’s 1999 guidance further demonstrates that the agencies definition of reasonably foreseeable actions in the NorthMet FEIS is too restrictive and violates NEPA. As explained by EPA, “reasonably foreseeable future actions need to be considered even if they are not specific proposals.”437 As with CEQ, EPA directs agencies to utilize the best available information “to develop scenarios that predict which future actions might reasonably be expected as a result of the proposal.”438 The NEPA requirement, as explained by CEQ, EPA, and the courts, to use reasonable forecasting and to develop scenarios that predict and disclose the environmental consequences of future actions, along with the NorthMet proposal and other past and present actions, is particularly important for the NorthMet proposal due to its extremely long time-frame. The lead agencies recognize in the FEIS that the necessary maintenance, mitigation, and monitoring for the NorthMet mine will be required indefinitely, likely for hundreds of years. In light of the lead agencies current understanding of the copper, nickel and other mineral deposits within the “Duluth Complex,” along with the expressed interest of mining companies from across the globe to access and mine these minerals, it is at least “reasonably foreseeable” to anticipate additional mining proposals during this time frame. In fact, it is arbitrary and unreasonable for the agencies to assume that no additional copper nickel mines will be proposed and considered during the hundreds of years of mining activities that the agencies are considering authorizing for PolyMet’s NorthMet mine. The lead agencies must therefore consider a range of development scenarios that meaningfully assess and disclose what the cumulative impacts would be to the various resources of the region under each of these scenarios. Because the FEIS fails to do so, a Supplemental EIS must be prepared.",CUM,S,O,5,SDEIS Theme CU 02. FEIS Section 6.1
Erin Mittag,"The agencies unlawfully narrow definition of reasonably foreseeable future actions led the agencies to exclude the proposed Twin Metals copper-nickel mine from the FEIS’ cumulative impacts analysis.439 From its 8,800 square-foot headquarters in Ely that was constructed in 2011, to its past, ongoing, and proposed exploration throughout the region, and its proposed hydro-geologic study, along with the ongoing consideration of the environmental impacts of its proposed lease renewals by the BLM, the Twin Metals proposal and its environmental impacts are far beyond “speculative,” and are instead ongoing or at least reasonably foreseeable. Significantly, in 2014 Twin Metals completed a voluminous “Technical Report on Pre- feasibility Study” (PFS), which was prepared by a large team of engineers and describes in detail where the company plans to mine, the characteristics of the mine site, the mineral reserve estimates, the proposed mine plan, the mining methods, the recovery methods, the project infrastructure, and, environmental protection strategies, and environmental concerns and issues.440 The Twin Metals proposal includes a 30-year mine plan focused on the development of the Maturi and Maturi SW mineral deposits, located about 9 miles southeast of Ely and 11 miles northeast of Babbitt. The PFS estimates an average production rate of 50,000 tons of mineralized ore per day. The mine plan consists of four major facilities: an underground mine site, a concentrator site, a tailings basin facility, and utility corridors. The Twin Metals PFS demonstrates that there will undoubtedly be significant cumulative impacts to numerous resources that would also be affected by the NorthMet project, as Twin Metals proposes to place its massive tailings facility in the same St. Louis River watershed, adjacent to the Peter Mitchell Mine. The agencies have entirely failed to consider or disclose in the NorthMet FEIS the major impacts and issues concerning geology, hydrology, groundwater, surface water, and pollution that would result from the interactions and cumulative impacts of the NorthMet mine site, Peter Mitchell mine pit, and Twin Metals tailings basin in the same general location. Without such an analysis, that also takes into account the existing changes and predicted impacts to the Laurentian Divide, the agencies are wholly unable to predict or disclose the extent of pollution that would flow to the St. Louis River and Boundary Waters watersheds. According to Twin Metals, the details from the PFS will “form a Mine Plan of Operations (MPO) that will be submitted to state and federal regulatory agencies for environmental review.”441 Twin Metals further states that it has been conducting environmental studies and assessments of its mine proposal for “more than five years,” which will continue during the development of its Mine Plan of Operations, and “will feed into the formal, Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS) that will be conducted by state and federal agencies. Key environmental issues include: surface water quality and hydrology, threatened and endangered species, air quality, plant life, wetlands and socioeconomic factors.” And “[m]ore than $250 million has been invested in exploration and project development to date.”443 In sum, there is no question that the Twin Metals proposed mine is not “speculative,” but rather “reasonably foreseeable,” and was required by NEPA and MEPA to be included in the cumulative impacts assessment for NorthMet FEIS.",CUM,S,O,7,Twin Metals is located outside of cumulative effects spatial and temporal boundaries for affected resources.
Erin Mittag,"In fact, in March of 2013, the “Minnesota Minerals Coordinating Committee,” which includes the DNR, issued a document entitled “Explore Minnesota: Copper, Nickel PGEs.”444 The document stated that PolyMet, Twin Metals, and Teck American were all “active” copper-nickel projects at that time. Moreover, the document referred to the Twin Metals PFS, which was then underway, acknowledged that the PFS will be comprehensive and evaluate all project details, and then stated: “Once completed, the PFS will provide multiple state and federal agencies the information needed to conduct a rigorous and thorough environmental review of the proposed plan.” Now that the PFS is complete, and provides the agencies with hundreds of pages concerning the proposed mine’s specific details and impacts, the lead agencies still refuse to include Twin Metals in the cumulative impacts analysis for the NorthMet proposal, in plain violation of MEPA and NEPA. Considering additional future proposals, including Twin Metals, is further supported by the definition of “cumulative potential effects,” within Minnesota’s regulations: ""Cumulative potential effects"" means the effect on the environment that results from the incremental effects of a project in addition to other projects in the environmentally relevant area that might reasonably be expected to affect the same environmental resources, including future projects actually planned or for which a basis of expectation has been laid, regardless of what person undertakes the other projects or what jurisdictions have authority over the projects. . . . In determining if a basis of expectation has been laid for a project, an RGU must determine whether a project is reasonably likely to occur and, if so, whether sufficiently detailed information is available about the project to contribute to the understanding of cumulative potential effects. In making these determinations, the RGU must consider: whether any applications for permits have been filed with any units of government; whether detailed plans and specifications have been prepared for the project; whether future development is indicated by adopted comprehensive plans or zoning or other ordinances; whether future development is indicated by historic or forecasted trends; and any other factors determined to be relevant by the RGU.445 The lead agencies violated MEPA because they failed to address whether there is a “basis of expectation” that Twin Metals will proceed.446 Moreover, the agencies violated this regulation by further failing to consider the “detailed plans and specifications” already been prepared for Twin Metals, including its 500+ page Technical Report on Pre-feasibility Study.447 The agencies failed to consider whether “historic or forecasted trends” indicate that Twin Metals is reasonably likely to be approved.448 It does not take a serious study of the history of the Iron Range to know that virtually all proposed mining projects and mining expansions have been approved in the past, which the agencies did not consider before concluding that Twin Metals remains “speculative.” The agencies also refused to consider Teck and its leases, exploration and drilling on the Mesaba deposit, adjacent to the NorthMet site. As explained in the FEIS comments provided by Andrew Comfort, the FEIS is wrong that the Teck and PolyMet projects are 3 miles apart.449 They are instead immediately adjacent to one another, and the agencies have failed to consider the continuous band of ore that connects PolyMet’s proposal to Teck and the Mesabi deposit.450 Relatedly, the agencies’ cumulative impacts analysis in the FEIS also fails to address PolyMet’s plans for future expansion and/or for the Plant Site to be utilized for future copper-nickel mining projects in this region. Because the plant capacity is three times as large as is needed for the proposed NorthMet project, its use for other projects is likely.451 As explained in an Edison Investment Research Limited report, “there is a good chance PolyMet will be able to expand the size of its resource by 50-100% based on what we learned on a site visit.”452 Additionally, “[t]here are roughly 11 mineral properties within shipping distance of PolyMet’s mill,” and “[w]e believe there is a good chance PolyMet will decide to toll process third-party ore from some relationships with one or more local projects.”453 Of course the additional use of this Plant Site for expansions and other mining proposals would significantly increase the amount of waste that would be deposited into the tailings basin. This would also greatly increase the amount of vehicle and rail traffic and other disturbances in the immediate project area and affecting numerous resources. The agencies, however, failed to consider the “forecasted trend” for PolyMet and the NorthMet mine site, as analyzed and disclosed by Edison and brought to the agencies’ attention during the NorthMet public comment period, in violation of NEPA and MEPA.",CUM,S,O,7,SDEIS Theme CU 02. FEIS Section 6.1
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS also fails to set forth the proper geographic scope for the cumulative impacts analysis, especially concerning the potential impacts to water, wetlands, and aquatics, where the agencies refuse to extend the scope of analysis to the entire St. Louis River watershed. There can be no dispute that past and ongoing mining and related activities have resulted in major, significant impacts to the St. Louis River watershed, all the way downstream to the estuary which is formally designated as an “Area of Concern.”454 From thousands of acres of permanent wetlands destruction, to sulfate pollution that has wiped out miles of historic wild rice, to mercury related health warnings, the agencies cannot simply ignore a century of impacts from mining and other industrial activities on this watershed.455 As further explained by Tribal Cooperating Agencies, nearly half of the St. Louis River watershed “has experienced hydrologic alteration from extensive ditching.”456 It is reasonably foreseeable that an additional 3000 acres of wetlands within the watershed will be directly impacted by proposed new mining projects and expansions that are in active permitting and/or environmental review: the PolyMet NorthMet project, Mesabi Nugget Phase II, US Steel Minntac expansion, US Steel Keetac expansion, United Taconite Tails Basin 3 construction. To date, virtually all required wetland mitigation for mining impacts has been implemented out of the basin, representing a permanent loss of high quality ecological resources and functions.457 Similarly, in looking forward, the agencies cannot simply proclaim that no specific mine, by itself, will have any significant impacts on the entire watershed. First, the agencies are wrong that large-scale open-pit mining, including the proposed PolyMet mine, will not have significant impacts on numerous resources, including water and wetlands. Second, both NEPA and MEPA recognize that cumulatively significant impacts may occur as the result of a number of individually insignificant impacts taking place over time within the same watershed.",CUM,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme CU 02
Erin Mittag,"This is an error that the FEIS makes again and again, for virtually every type of impact. From the air deposition of mercury in area lakes, to ambient air pollution and regional haze, to the loss of critical habitat, to impacts on state-listed endangered plants, the FEIS compares the level of impact from this project to the overall impact and deems the impacts from this project insignificant and thus not of concern, even in regards to the cumulative problem. The FEIS must reveal the level of cumulative impact that all sources together have on impacted resources, and acknowledge that the proposed NorthMet project would be one of many sources that together cause the impacts.",CUM,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme CU 02
Erin Mittag,"Due to the major deficiencies in the cumulative effects analysis for the NorthMet proposal, the Tribal Cooperating Agencies prepared their own.459 As explained by the Tribes, the lead agencies failed to consider their repeated requests to utilize a tool developed by the EPA in 2011 in cooperation with tribes entitled, “Applying Cumulative Impact Analysis Tools to Tribes and Tribal Lands.” This is despite the Mine Site and Plant Site, and resulting impacts, being located within the 1854 Ceded Territory, and upstream from the Fond du Lac Reservation. The Tribes thus undertook “a resource-specific GIS-based approach as defined in the 2011 guidance to generate an alternative [cumulative effects analysis] that more accurately accounts for cumulative impacts to resources of tribal significance.”460 The Co-Lead Agencies, however, failed to utilize or consider this contradictory and more detailed cumulative impacts analysis in the FEIS, in violation of NEPA.",CUM,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes CU 03, CU 12"
Erin Mittag,"Additional major flaws with the FEIS’ cumulative effects analysis are set forth in the November 13, 2015 request by the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa for predecisional referral of the North Met proposal to CEQ.462 As explained by Fond du Lac, bedrock and surficial groundwater pollution is already documented at the same site PolyMet intends to use for the NorthMet project (the LTV site), and the Dunka Pit. As the Band has requested, the agencies must consider and disclose the cumulative impacts of the NorthMet proposal, LTV site, Dunka Pit, as well as the groundwater pollution from nearby iron ore mines, including the Peter Mitchell Pit, Laskin Energy, Arcelor-Mittal, United Taconite, and US Steel Minntac. Moreover, the Band reiterated the need for a geographically broader and watershed-based cumulative impacts analysis that takes into account other major proposals such as United Taconite’s proposal for 1,200 acres of wetland destruction to build a new tailings basin, and the existing pollution that is already causing water quality standard violations in the St. Louis River watershed.",WAT,S,O,10,MDNR 2015c
Erin Mittag,"22.0 The Co-Lead Agencies Fail to Assess Direct and Cumulative Impacts on Wildlife. The FEIS fails to assess the cumulative impacts on sensitive wildlife species, which the FEIS defines to include federal and state-listed species, species of special concern, and Forest Service sensitive species.463 This issue was raised in our comments on the SDEIS at MCEA 118 and CBD 73-75, which are attached and incorporated herein. We also submitted a supplementary letter to Forest Supervisor Brenda Halter on October 8, 2015, which we incorporate herein. The FEIS neither mentions this issue in its Response to Comments, nor includes material in the text of the FEIS that responds to the issue, in violation of 40 C.F.R. § 1503.4(a) (agency must consider and respond to comments) and 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(b) (agency must discuss in FEIS “any responsible opposing view,” and “shall indicate the agency’s response to the issues raised”). The FEIS claims that the cumulative effects analysis for wildlife “focuses on potential losses to sensitive wildlife species.”464 In fact, however, the FEIS provides only a few pages of very general information, with the vast majority of sensitive species not even mentioned. There is therefore no scientific support for the agencies’ conclusion that the proposed NorthMet mine, along with all other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions, “would not further threaten special status wildlife species.”465 Although Chapters 4 and 5 of the FEIS list many species of concern that either are found at the project site or for which the project site provides habitat, and Chapter 5 at least purports to assess the impacts that the NorthMet project alone would have on these species, Chapter 6 provides no comparable analysis for cumulative impacts. And yet almost all of the species of concern are on the list of Regional Forester Sensitive Species (RFSS) due to current or expected cumulative losses of habitat across their range within the region.466 Without an analysis or explanation of the ultimate impact on these species from cumulative losses and how the NorthMet project would contribute to those losses, the FEIS does not provide the “hard look” at impacts required by NEPA. NEPA requires the Forest Service to consider the potential cumulative effects of proposed actions.467 “To ‘consider’ cumulative effects, some quantified or detailed information is required.”468 “Without such information, neither the courts nor the public, in reviewing the [agency’s] decisions, can be assured that the [agency] provided the hard look that it is required to provide.”469 “General statements about ‘possible’ effects and ‘some risk’ do not constitute a ‘hard look’ absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.”470 In its cumulative impacts analysis for wildlife, the FEIS provides only very general statements concerning risks and impacts, which falls far short of the detailed and quantified analysis required by NEPA. The sum of the assessment is found in three statements. First: Cumulative effects on wildlife may include the loss and/or fragmentation of habitat and encroachments into critical wildlife travel corridors...471 Second: In addition to habitat fragmentation and loss and effects on wildlife crossing corridors, wildlife species of concern in the Nashwauk Uplands and Laurentian Uplands ecological subsections are subject to other stressors that could result in cumulative effects. Traffic and activity related to mining projects, urban development, forestry, tourism, and road expansions all increase the risk for special status wildlife species and, as such, could result in cumulative effects.472 And finally, in regards to wildlife travel corridors: Wildlife could be affected by the NorthMet Project Proposed Action and other actions through a cumulative disruption of their travel corridors. These actions could pose additional barriers to wildlife movement by increasing the number of isolated patches of suitable habitat, increasing mortality during transit, and physically blocking travel. This may lead to increased population and genetic isolation and decreased meta- population dynamics, which in turn could lead to decreases in overall population stability and persistence. The FEIS provides additional cursory information about the approach it used to reach this “assessment,” including the spatial boundaries; the timeframe; the list of past, present, and foreseeable future actions considered; the causes of habitat changes; the vegetation types of affected habitats; and the list of wildlife corridors and projects affecting them. But aside from a couple of brief paragraphs on federally-listed species (which are addressed below), the three statements quoted above are all the cumulative assessment says about the actual impacts on wildlife. The FEIS provides no information on the status of or impacts to any specific species. As an example of what is missing, the FEIS tells us that loss of wildlife habitat in the Laurentian Uplands will be due primarily to timber harvest and mining, while losses in the Nashwauk Uplands will be due primarily due to mining and urban development.474 But it completely fails to tell us what those losses are expected to be, or how they will impact specific species. Without explaining why more detailed and quantified information cannot be provided, these very general statements are insufficient and fail to comply with NEPA.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected a similar cumulative effects analysis for a proposed mining project. In Great Basin Mine Watch v. Hankins, the court struck down the agency’s reliance on the same sort of brief, generalized descriptions of mining impacts in the region.476 The court required the agency to include “mine-specific ... cumulative data.”477 Relying on prior cases, the court highlighted the need for a “quantified assessment of [other projects] combined environmental impacts” and “objective quantification of the impacts.”478 The FEIS for the proposed PolyMet mine similarly fails to provide the required detailed analysis of cumulative impacts. Moreover, the cumulative effects analysis entirely fails to even mention moose, despite the documented presence of moose in the area, its rapidly declining population and designation as a species of special concern, its iconic status to the citizens of Minnesota, and its cultural significance to the Tribes. The agencies’ failure to address such a fundamentally important issue violates NEPA. Chapter 5 of the FEIS acknowledges that the proposed mine by itself “would likely affect moose individuals in the vicinity through habitat loss and fragmentation”;480 cumulative impacts to moose and moose habitat should be obvious. As noted by the Tribal cooperating agencies in their comments on the initial DEIS for this project, the Minnesota advisory committee studying the decline of the moose population in northeastern Minnesota recommended preserving wetlands as sanctuaries for moose from heat stress.481 Yet PolyMet is proposing the largest wetland fill ever permitted in this region, and additional losses will follow with other mining activity. Wetland mitigation for the PolyMet project will be located outside of the area that still supports a moose population, as will the largest tract of the replacement lands that the Forest Service will receive in the land exchange. This loss will undoubtedly be joined by other losses of wetlands throughout Minnesota’s remaining moose territory, but the FEIS provides no information on what the extent of those losses is likely to be. The lack of information on the projected cumulative impacts",WI,S,O,7,"FEIS Section 6.2.5.4.3; FEIS App D BA Section 6.1.4, 6.2.4, 6.3.4; BE 4.5.2. SDEIS Theme WI 01"
Erin Mittag,"In addition to its gaps in crucial information, the NorthMet BE minimizes the amount of impacted acres from the project to “158 acres of mature upland forest habitat” that “would be directed affected” and compares it to “625,000 acres of upland forest within the CESA that could now, or in the reasonably foreseeable future, provide habitat for northern goshawk,” concluding that “habitat loss from the Project would have a negligible cumulative effect on northern goshawks in the CESA.”485 But further investigation reveals that the 625,000 acre figure does not take account of any factors that make large portions of that forest unsuitable for goshawks, including fragmentation, age, size of patches, and noises and other disturbances. It is patently false that in the reasonably foreseeable future, this forest will become less fragmented, older, and subject to less noise and disturbance. The Glacier Project BE reveals that forest-wide, the predicted suitable habitat for northern goshawks (large patches of upland mature forest) is about 300,000 acres.486 It is unclear from the FEIS or the BE how many acres of suitable habitat will be directly and indirectly affected by the NorthMet project. This would include acreage that, while not directly impacted, is lost to goshawks because it is no longer contained within a large enough patch of mature upland forest.487 It would also include acreage affected by noise, traffic, and human presence. For the cumulative effects analysis, added to that would be habitat similarly affected by other past, present, and foreseeable future projects. The Glacier Project BE also reveals that “Foraging areas for nesting goshawk can range from 21,000 to 27,200 acres surrounding the nest site,” which again puts the total of 300,000 available acres in perspective. It would appear from these numbers that there is only sufficient habitat for about 15 breeding pairs of northern goshawks within the Superior National Forest, although the Forest Plan provides a goal of 20 to 30 breeding pairs. The loss of even one breeding pair appears significant in this context, and would be even more significant if additional breeding pairs are threatened by other foreseeable projects and activities. But the FEIS gives us none of this information. In sum, due to the failure of the FEIS to provide meaningful and detailed information and analysis, neither the public nor agency decision-makers have any idea what this project means for northern goshawks in Minnesota or the Superior National Forest. The FEIS has not done its job.",WI,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WI 01, WI 11"
Erin Mittag,"The FEIS provides even less information on great gray owls, which also use the site.488 The best information we were able to obtain--again, outside of the FEIS--was the last annual wildlife survey report released by the Superior National Forest in 2009. This report indicates that surveys of the “Laurentian Forest Province of Minnesota” observed one great gray owl in 2008 and two in 2009.489 Nesting information from the same report states, MOU records show one nesting record in Lake County. The Biotics database listed two nests in 2004 and four nests as of 2009: the latest two were found and protected, and are annually monitored by FS biologists. NRRI observed one individual during forest breeding bird surveys between 1991 and 2002. There are approximately 36 great gray owl nesting platforms on the SNF since 2007. Platforms have been monitored every year with no detections as of yet.490 This report indicates that the fact that great gray owls have been seen nesting and hunting at the PolyMet site is far more significant than one might suppose from reading the FEIS.

Erin Mittag,"While northern goshawks, great gray owls, and moose are three species that are known to make use of the mine site and the federal lands, the site also provides habitat for a number of other sensitive species, which are listed in the BE and FEIS.491 The FEIS must also provide substantially more information on these species of concern, their habitat, and threats to their habitat throughout the Superior National Forest and the state of Minnesota in order to provide a rational and scientifically supported basis for the agencies’ judgment as to the significance of the loss of habitat from this project in conjunction with other past, present and reasonably foreseeable actions The agencies’ consideration and disclosure of the cumulative impacts to federally-listed lynx, wolves, and the northern long-eared bat in the FEIS is also insufficient. Each of these imperiled species has been identified as present in the affected region, and would admittedly be adversely affected by the proposed mine.492 But the FEIS provides only general and already obvious information that does not satisfy the hard look required by NEPA.493 The FEIS, for instance, discloses that cumulative impacts would result in “additional” habitat fragmentation, “may increase pressures” for lynx and wolves, “would likely result” in additional traffic and potential collisions, and “could affect” northern long-eared bats through habitat destruction and fragmentation.494 Yet the FEIS fails to take the next required step to quantify or estimate the extent and magnitude of these anticipated cumulative impacts in any way, or otherwise explain what these cumulative impacts could mean for these already imperiled populations in the region.

Erin Mittag,"We also object to geographical limitations on the projects and activities considered in the cumulative impacts assessment for wildlife.495 According to the text, The spatial CEAA [Cumulative Effects Assessment Area] for wildlife includes the portions of the Mesabi Iron Range located within the Nashwauk Uplands and Laurentian Uplands ecological subsections (see Figure 6.1.1-1). The area has been limited to the Mesabi Iron Range, as it is a definable physiographic region encompassing the region’s mining, which represents an influential land use in regards to wildlife and wildlife habitat. Figure 6.1.1-1 shows the “Mesabi Iron Range” within the “Nashwauk Uplands” and the “Laurentian Uplands” to be a very narrow band of territory with no relationship to the range of any of the wildlife species of concern. Despite the above language, the assessment is not limited to the Iron Range for anything except mining projects. For example, the scant information provided on changes to habitat in the area are given for the entire Nashwauk Uplands and Laurentian Uplands areas.497 And in regards to non-mining projects, the impacts of both “community growth and development” and “forestry practices” are given at the “regional” level, which is undefined. Regarding impacts from mining, however, the FEIS inexplicably omits activity outside the narrow band of the Iron Range. In May 2012, the Forest Service completed an EIS for 29 federal hardrock mineral prospecting permits that acknowledged impacts to wildlife including up to 163 miles of new roads, increased traffic volume, and the increased noise from drilling.498 Although the mineral prospecting EIS was limited to an identified number of projects where the federal government owns the mineral rights, there are many additional mineral exploration projects within and near the Superior National Forest where the mineral rights are owned by private interests or the State, along with numerous other projects that were not included in the NorthMet FEIS.4 Additionally, the BLM is currently considering potential lease renewals for Twin Metals, which would result in additional exploration and other mining activities.500 And the Forest Service recently released an Environmental Assessment for the Twin Metals hydrogeological study; the Biological Evaluation from that project is included here.501 All of these projects will have impacts on wildlife, each of which may not be significant standing alone, but are very likely to be significant in the aggregate. None of these projects, however, are considered in the FEIS cumulative impacts analysis for the NorthMet project. Defining an area for the assessment of cumulative impacts must begin by looking at the resource that is potentially affected. If viability of a species within the Superior National Forest is being assessed, the appropriate area for assessing past, present and foreseeable future activities that could cumulatively impact the species is the Superior National Forest. If viability within the state is being assessed, the appropriate area is that area of the state that provides habitat for the species. Without providing information on foreseeable threats to a species in other portions of its territory, it is impossible to know the import of threats within whatever narrow area the agencies arbitrarily choose to assess.",CUM,S,O,2,"SDEIS Themes CU 01, CU 02, CU 10"

Erin Mittag,"The cumulative effects analysis for rare plants provides the same delineation of the “cumulative effects assessment area” (CEAA) as is discussed above for wildlife, i.e, the portion of the Iron Range within the Nashwauk and Laurentian Uplands.502 It then discusses the number of populations of rare plants for which Takings Permits have been issued within the CEAA.503 But rather than comparing the number of affected populations in the CEAA with the total number of populations in the CEAA, it instead provides a comparison with the number of populations statewide. The FEIS simply assumes that all populations outside the CEAA are secure, an assumption that has no basis in the record. Furthermore, limitation of the analysis to impacts for which Takings Permits have been issued very likely understates the impacts. According to the assessment for three plant species, none are expected to be indirectly affected. We question whether Takings Permits are an appropriate means to assess indirect effects; we doubt that mining companies have applied for Takings Permits for such effects, which are usually somewhat uncertain until after they occur. At any rate, the fact that as much as 8 percent of the statewide population of one species (ternate grapefern) is expected to be directly affected by currently planned “takings” on the Iron Range alone gives one reason for pause. Without some information about threats to this species throughout its range in Minnesota, the conclusion that “the cumulative effects of the NorthMet Project Proposed Action and other reasonably foreseeable activities are not expected to jeopardize the presence of B. rugulosum in Minnesota” is unfounded.

Erin Mittag,"As in so much of the FEIS, the discussion on amphibole mineral fibers begins by minimizing the issue. The first sentence states that the Duluth Complex “may” contain amphibole mineral fibers, as though the very presence of amphibole fibers is still unknown.511 This is contradicted by the text in the FEIS itself.512 The introduction goes on to state that taconite ore from the Northshore Mine “has received public attention with regard to potential releases of amphibole mineral fibers.”513 There is nothing “potential” about these releases; the Minnesota Department of Health and Pollution Control Agency have reams of data stretching over forty years indicating high levels of amphibole mineral fibers emitted from the Peter Mitchell Pit and the Northshore Mining processing plant.",AIR,S,N,12,FEIS Section 5.2.7.5.3.
Erin Mittag,"The debate over the toxicity of mineral fibers released by mining in Northeastern Minnesota has long rested on the premise that because these fibers are not “asbestos,” nothing is known about their toxicity; the NorthMet FEIS follows in this vein. Rather than designing studies to look at the toxicity of these fibers, industry has tried to keep attention on the toxicity of “asbestos” fibers and the alleged impossibility of correlating the information.",AIR,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"In the meantime, Phil Cook and a number of researchers studying the fibers that have cost so many lives in Libby, Montana, have set aside the argument over what is and is not “asbestos” or “asbestiform” and have instead looked at toxicity studies of a range of fibers with variable factors such as particle dimensions, mass, shape, surface area, and material type. As some of these researchers point out in a 2011 journal article, “For regulatory and health assessment purposes, it is microscopical morphology that counts: there is no evidence that potentially affected cells can distinguish between ‘asbestiform’ and ‘nonasbestiform’ fibres having the equivalent dimensions.”514 The EPA put together a database of 70 mineral fiber samples used in biological studies and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).515 The database includes fibers from the Peter Mitchell Pit, several types of UICC asbestos fibers, and other mineral fibers not classified as asbestos.516 This work was done in response to the understanding that although non-asbestos fibers (including “cleavage fragments”) may not be as toxic as asbestos, that does not mean that they are benign. As Dr. Roberts pointed out in his report to MDH, The current approach for evaluating risk from airborne asbestos dates back to 1986 and is based upon measurement of fibers of a specified size and aspect ratio (i.e., length-width ratio) using phase contrast microscopy (PCM). There are a number of problems with this approach related to the technology for fiber detection and measurement [PCM], the way in which mineral fibers of interest are defined, and the assumption that a single toxic potency value is adequate to characterize risk from all relevant mineral fiber types. . . . . . Further, there is also concern mineral fibers that pose cancer risk by inhalation may be defined too narrowly, and that a single potency value for asbestos is too simplistic to adequately cover the variety of fiber sources and exposures that exists. Dr. Roberts was tasked with assessing whether the EPA database provided sufficient information to allow estimates of toxicity of a range of mineral fibers, wholly aside from their categorization as “asbestos.” Specifically, Dr. Roberts was asked to answer three questions: 1. Can the available data be used to provide fiber potency estimates? 2. Are available data adequate for dose-response modeling? 3. Is physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PB-PK) modeling feasible? The answer to all three questions was “yes.”518 At the time the report was written (2010), Dr. Roberts noted that although PB-PK modeling was feasible, it did not yet exist, but that it was being developed through the Libby Action Plan and would likely be available in the near future.519 That work has now been done, and was reported on at the Duluth Conference. Thus if the statement in the NorthMet FEIS that “[t]he Co-lead Agencies believe that there is currently incomplete and unavailable scientific information to characterize the health risk to the public from exposure to mineral fibers and that the means to obtain such information are not known” is true, it is only because the agencies have failed to investigate and inform themselves of the current state of the science. At the Duluth Conference, Acting Division Director Dale Hoff presented the late Phil Cook’s work on calculating fiber potency estimates. The framework was to set the toxicity of UICC amosite asbestos at a potency of 1.0, and to estimate the relative potencies of other fibers as indicated by modeling based on the data in the EPA database. To our knowledge this material has not yet been published, but the methodology and database are available. The EPA estimates that 0.0004 UICC amosite asbestos fibers per cubic centimeter in ambient air will result in one additional cancer per 10,000 people.521 While the discussion below relates to cancer risks, non-malignant health risks can be of even greater concern.",AIR,NS,X,1,
Erin Mittag,"We recognize that the sum of the various types of fibers that are emitted by the mining industry in Northeastern Minnesota is likely less toxic than amosite asbestos. However, any assessment of the impact on public health has to include a discussion of the level of fibers in the ambient air, both before and during operation of the proposed mine. Information on existing fiber levels is available from MPCA and MDH. This information should have been included in the FEIS, along with a comparison to levels in a non-impacted area.",AIR,S,N,8,SDEIS Theme AIR 03. The approach described in the FEIS is to control for particulate emissions to a high degree. FEIS pgs. 5-518 to 5-519.
Erin Mittag,"We are submitting two exhibits containing monitoring data for ambient air in Silver Bay, Beaver Bay, and Babbitt. The most recent data we have for Silver Bay (F1) and Beaver Bay (F7) is contained on an Excel spreadsheet prepared by MPCA staff and provided to Le Lind on January 24, 2007.523 The average amphibole fiber count in the ambient air in Silver Bay (F1) in 2006 was 4,998 fibers per cubic meter.524 The average amphibole fiber count in the ambient air in Beaver Bay (F7) in 2006 was 5,823 fibers per cubic meter. This translates to 0.0050 fibers per cc in Silver Bay and 0.0058 fibers per cc in Beaver Bay. If these fibers were as toxic as amosite asbestos, this would translate to an increased cancer risk of 12.5 and 14.5 in 10,000. We are also submitting three sampling data sheets for monitoring in Babbitt in 2008.525 One had a result of zero; the average of the other two samples is 8,806 amphibole fibers per cubic meter, or 0.0088 fibers per cc. This would amount to an estimated increased cancer risk of 22 in 10,000 for amosite asbestos. Thus even if the sum of toxicity of fibers from Minnesota mines is only one-tenth the toxicity of amosite asbestos, the ambient air in Minnesota mining communities is already above the EPA benchmark, which is regarded as an indicator of an acceptable level of risk.526 The Minnesota Air Toxics Study published in 2005 reported on monitored levels of listed air toxics between 1996 and 2001. Although the study found that a few substances were present in ambient air at above the benchmark for an additional 1 in 100,000 increased cancer risk, no substance was present above the benchmark for an additional 1 in 10,000 increased cancer risk at any location. This indicates that even if the sum of toxicity of fibers from Minnesota mines is one-hundredth the toxicity of amosite asbestos, it is still one of the most serious air toxics health issues in Minnesota. This situation is allowed to continue in part because the State focuses attention on epidemiological studies in regard to mineral fibers from mining, while for every other toxic substance (and for mineral fibers from any other industry), allowable levels in the ambient air are based on toxicological studies. Limitations based on toxicological studies protect the public at a level that is not measurable in the local population by epidemiological studies. Given the size of the local population, it would be impossible to detect an increase of one additional cancer in 10,000 people on the Iron Range, much less assign a cause. And yet discussions of the toxicity of fibers in the ambient air on the Iron Range and North Shore invariably center on epidemiological studies such as the Minnesota Taconite Workers Study. The NorthMet FEIS repeats this pattern.527 Minnesota agencies apparently will not require that amphibole fibers in the ambient air in Northeastern Minnesota remain below a certain level until the increase in cancer in the general population is measurable, despite the fact that MDH consistently rejects such an approach as insufficiently protective of public health. Standard agency practice for protecting the public from airborne toxins is nowhere to be found in the public discourse.",AIR,S,N,12,"SDEIS Themes AIR 03, HU 05, HU 07, HU 08"
Erin Mittag,"Turning to the proposed NorthMet project, any additional health risks from fiber emissions would add to an ongoing problem. The current situation does not allow for permitting a new facility and then monitoring to find out if the fiber level in ambient air in local communities increases. We are already past that point. As the NorthMet FEIS acknowledges, amphibole fibers are present in the NorthMet ore. The discussion of the levels of fibers in the ore attempts to minimize concern without telling us anything about what the level actually is. The text states that “amphibole mineral fibers were found to represent a relatively small percent of the mineral fibers associated with the processing of NorthMet Deposit ore; approximately 9 percent of the fibers identified from all collected samples of ore, tailings, and process water.”528 But the text does not tell us the total number of fibers identified or the volume of ore, tailings, and process water that they were identified in, so 9 percent means absolutely nothing. The text goes on to say that “It is not possible to accurately quantify the amount of fibers that might be emitted from the facility.” This is a curious statement in light of the quantification of emissions of virtually every other possible pollutant.529 The FEIS provides no explanation or reference for this judgment. This statement appears to set up a hurdle for the assessment of fiber emissions that is counter to both NEPA and the other analyses in the FEIS. While we agree that assessments should provide the greatest degree of accuracy possible, NEPA does not allow agencies to forego an assessment because it will not meet some undefined level of accuracy. Instead, the agency must use the best methods and data available, with explanations of the uncertainty involved. Taking an example from the FEIS itself, the water quality modeling provides variable inputs of water quality that may differ by orders of magnitude to consider a range of scenarios. For some of these estimates, there is no correlation between the modeled “continuation of existing conditions” and actual existing conditions at the site. Given the sophistication of air modeling in use today, we find it hard to believe that a similar level of accuracy is not possible for fiber emissions. Quantifying emissions involves two steps: measuring fiber levels in rock or process and waste streams; and applying emission factors and modeling to estimate levels in the ambient air. We found nothing in the record that indicates either of these cannot be done, and the FEIS does not say which of these steps makes the analysis impossible. Throughout the FEIS, analogs of other mine pits, waste rock, river systems, etc. are used where there is a lack of site-specific information. In addition, values from the Regional Copper Nickel Study are often included in analyses, and were in fact included in the discussion of fibers. Rough estimates of fiber levels in the ore and of the resulting impacts on ambient air can be drawn from these sources. In regards to measuring fibers in the ore, the study presented in Barr 2007l was done for precisely this purpose. We did not find an explanation of why this information could not be used as a basis for an estimate of the average level of fibers in the ore; if it is because the data set was not large enough, there is no explanation as to why a larger study could not be done.",AIR,S,N,8,SDEIS Theme AIR 03. The approach described in the FEIS is to control for particulate emissions to a high degree. FEIS pgs. 5-518 to 5-519.
Erin Mittag,"If PolyMet wants to perpetuate a lack of site-specific data, a report done for the Copper Nickel Study (and referenced in the FEIS) provides a comparison between the Duluth Complex and fiber levels in the Biwabik Formation, which hosts the Peter Mitchell Pit: “The Duluth Complex data show approximately 1/3 the amphibole content of the Biwabik formation. Based on this comparison, the Duluth gabbro will produce, on an average, concentrations of amphibole comparable to or less than those of Reserve Mining Company.”530 The authors of the Copper Nickel Study obviously believed that enough was or could be known about the level of fibers in ore and the fate of those fibers in processing to support modeling of fiber levels in ambient air.531 While the modeling for the Copper Nickel Study cannot be used directly for the NorthMet FEIS because the scenario modeled included a smelter and a larger volume of ore being processed, a similar site-specific modeling effort cannot be impossible for the NorthMet project. Indeed, the Copper Nickel Study explicitly expected that such an effort would be undertaken before permitting a particular project: “[T]hese estimates simply serve to highlight areas requiring further investigation. The site- specific considerations for a smelter (and tailing basin) must clearly address this question in the light of more detailed data.” 532 Furthermore, the Stevenson report combined with analog information from the communities affected by Northshore Mining provides another avenue for a NEPA-level assessment of potential impacts from the proposed NorthMet mine. We assume that ambient air fiber levels in Babbitt in 2008 stem from the Peter Mitchell Pit; LTV had ceased operating by then, and Mesabi Nuggets had not yet started. Also, the processing plant in Silver Bay is the only local source of fibers in Silver Bay and Beaver Bay, so ambient levels in those locations can also provide an analog.",AIR,S,N,12,The approach described in the FEIS is to control for particulate emissions to a high degree.

Erin Mittag,"We assume that the NorthMet mine would process about 80% the amount of ore that Northshore Mining did in 2006, and we acknowledge that the best information available is that the NorthMet ore likely contains about one-third the amount of fibers as the Peter Mitchell Pit. However, at the NorthMet mine, the mine pit and the processing plant are close enough to each other that they would emit fibers to the same ambient air, which would approximately double the amount of fibers from one of the sources alone. This results in an emissions level of about half that affecting any of the mining communities in 2006 or 2008 (.8 x .33 x 2). Given the current level of fibers in the ambient air, increasing them by 50% without any attempt to assess the public health implications is unconscionable. And the planned Mesabi Nugget’s expansion would no doubt further add to the problem, depending on their source for taconite.",AIR,S,N,12,The approach described in the FEIS is to control for particulate emissions to a high degree.

Erin Mittag,"Rather than disclose this information in the FEIS to inform permitting and other agency decisions, the Co-lead Agencies propose controls for PM2.5, along with future monitoring. The levels of fibers present in the air from current mining operations reveal the fallacy of this approach. We have seen almost forty years of “regulation” of fibers at Northshore Mining, which has focused on installing supposed state-of-the-art particulate matter control technology. And while the fiber levels in ambient air are certainly lower than they would be without that technology, they still present a significant risk to public health.

Erin Mittag,"The FEIS Adopts An Overly-Narrow Purpose and Need Statement for the Co-Lead Agencies That Improperly Eliminates Reasonable Alternatives. The Purpose and Need Statements in the FEIS are improperly narrow, resulting in premature elimination of reasonable alternatives. The Co-Lead Agencies are expected to “briefly specify the underlying purpose and need to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives including the proposed action.”534 While the agency is free to take the needs of the project proposer into account, but those private interests should not define the scope of the purpose and need. Instead, Agencies must look hard at the factors relevant to the definition of purpose... Perhaps more importantly [than the need to take private interests into account], an agency should always consider the views of Congress, expressed, to the extent that the agency can determine them, in the agency’s statutory authorization to act, as well as in other congressional directives.535 As the Seventh Circuit has explained, “One obvious way for an agency to slip past the strictures of NEPA is to contrive a purpose so slender as to define competing ‘reasonable alternatives’ out of consideration (and even out of existence).”536An overly-narrow purpose that focuses on the needs of the applicant to mine a particular resource has the potential to narrow the range of alternatives “to those that would allow the miners to mine” the proposed property.537 The Purpose and Need Statements in the FEIS are categorized by entity, starting with PolyMet. While it is fine for the Co-Lead Agencies to include PolyMet’s purpose, it is not appropriate to use that statement as a basis for defining reasonable alternatives. Nor is it appropriate for the Co-Lead Agencies to defer to the applicant’s purpose and need, as noted above. Then follows the NorthMet Project and Land Exchange Purpose and Need Statement, which presumably applies to all Co-Lead Agencies.538 The first bullet point is: ? For PolyMet to utilize its leased mineral rights and recover commercial quantities and quality of semi-refined metal concentrates, hydroxides, and precipitates from the NorthMet ore body in northern Minnesota, and to process the recovered ore by reutilizing the former LTVSMC processing plant. This is an improper adoption of PolyMet’s purpose and need statement, as described above. This is PolyMet’s purpose and need, not the co-lead agencies. The third bullet point is: ? To extract and process metals in a technically and economically feasible manner, such that there would be sufficient income to cover: operating cost (which includes but is not limited to the cost of mining, processing, transportation, and waste management), capital cost (needed to build and sustain facilities), an adequate return to investors, reclamation, and closure costs and taxes. This is also an improper purpose and need statement for the Co-Lead Agencies. Putting an emphasis on whether PolyMet’s venture is profitable emphasizes PolyMet’s investors over environmental concerns. It is clearly designed to eliminate reasonable alternatives such as underground mining and the West Pit backfill from consideration, rather than to allow neutral assessment of those alternatives. By referencing the company’s plan, the company’s profitability, and the company’s processing plant, the agencies do not allow themselves any alternatives. They certainly do not allow for ore to come from any seam but the one identified by Polymet. DNR’s Purpose and Need statement is essentially a shortened version of PolyMet’s: The Purpose and Need of the Proposed Action is to produce base and precious metals precipitates and flotation concentrates from ore mined at the NorthMet Deposit by uninterrupted operation of the former LTVSMC processing plant. The processed resources would help meet domestic and global demand by sale of these products to domestic and world markets. This is the same Purpose and Need statement in the SDEIS.

It is an important part of the EIS process to know approximately how much money will need to be provided as a financial surety for closure and post-closure requirements, and that appropriate procedures and inclusive items are being used to estimate this amount.

Dave Chambers,"Category 1 Stockpile Water Containment System and Cover The engineered cutoff wall or “hydraulic barrier” is critical to meeting water quality requirements for the proposed project. Key factors for the cutoff wall will be: (1) How well the cutoff wall can be grouted into the fractured bedrock to avoid contaminants moving under the wall in more permeable sediments; (2) How effective the collection system on the upstream side of the cutoff wall is at removing pressure on this barrier; and, (3) The permeability contrast between the cutoff wall and the adjacent sediments. Cutoff Wall Contact with Bedrock The cutoff wall is to be installed by: • Cutoff Wall – the cutoff wall will be constructed using trenchless in-situ construction techniques whereby a mechanical mixer is inserted into the ground along the cutoff wall alignment. As the mixer ‘walks’ down the cutoff wall alignment, it mixes the soil along the cutoff wall location with bentonite. The soil-bentonite mixing occurs in-situ and an open trench is not utilized. DeWind One-Pass Trenching and Hayward Baker are examples of companies that provide such services. At locations where boulders are encountered that interfere with trenchless construction, the boulders will be removed using conventional excavation methods. Small diameter cobbles and boulders are expelled from the excavation as part of the trenchless construction process. (PolyMet 2015l, Attachment G, FTB Containment System Slope Stability Impacts p. 5) It might be difficult for an in-situ mechanical mixer to determine when it is really at the bedrock interface since no geologic logging or permeability measurements are being made. If the mechanical mixer does not reach fractured bedrock, for any reason, an zone of relatively higher permeability for contaminants to escape could be created. Collection System Cartoon diagrams of the seepage collections systems at the Category 1 Waste Rock Facility (Figure 3.2- 11) and the Tailings Impoundment (Figure 3.2-28) are presented on the following pages. If the seepage collection trenches are not extended to bedrock, as is depicted in Figure 3.2-28, or if the “drain pipes” are not placed at or near the bottom of the trenches, there will be more pressure attempting to push fluid through the cutoff wall. In the Geotechnical Data Package, Volume 1 – Flotation Tailings Basin (PolyMet 2015l), the seepage collection trenches for the tailings basin it is noted that: The seepage collection trench and drain pipe depth has not yet been finalized, but we assume an average depth of 8 feet to prevent system freezing and maintain operations through-out winter (exact depth will be determined during final design and construction). (PolyMet 2015l, p. 4) Even though the cutoff wall is designed to be low- permeability, more hydraulic pressure on this barrier will mean more seepage through or under the barrier. Permeability Contrast The cutoff wall would have a hydraulic conductivity specification of no more than 1x10-5 centimeters per second (cm/sec). (FEIS, p. 3-47) CSP2’s comments on DSEIS recommended 1x10-6 cm/sec. It's not clear why 10-5 is adequate, in that it only provides approximately one order of magnitude difference with some groundwater-carrying sediment units. For example, at the Tailings Basin (PolyMet 2015l, p. 13): ? Depth to bedrock ranges from 2 to 47 feet with an average depth of approximately 20 feet.

The pond and wetland would continue to lose water via seepage, but at a reduced rate compared to operations, as a result of the bentonite amendment of the tailings surface. (FEIS, p. 3-133) While the design of the bentonite cap will assist in limiting oxidation of the tailings, it violates one of the critical recommendations of the Mt Polley Expert Panel (2015) – that there be no wet closures” for tailings ponds. The Panel said: For new tailings facilities. BAT (Best Available Technology) should be actively encouraged for new tailings facilities at existing and proposed mines. Safety attributes should be evaluated separately from economic considerations, and cost should not be the determining factor. and; The goal of BAT for tailings management is to assure physical stability of the tailings deposit. This is achieved by preventing release of impoundment contents, independent of the integrity of any containment structures. In accomplishing this objective, BAT has three components that derive from first principles of soil mechanics: 1. Eliminate surface water from the impoundment. 2. Promote unsaturated conditions in the tailings with drainage provisions. 3. Achieve dilatant conditions throughout the tailings deposit by compaction. and; Where applicable, alternatives to water covers should be aggressively pursued. The design for the Tailings Basin at NorthMet meets none of these criteria. Cells 1E & 2E contain a relatively small amount of tailings. It would be feasible to design a new tailings dam, using the Category I waste rock as construction material, based on centerline design that could do away with the dangerous upstream construction method. The Tailings Basin already incorporates a cutoff wall so no additional seepage collection would need to be planned. A centerline dam design could also incorporate enhanced tailings drainage, which would promote the unsaturated conditions recommended by the Mt Polley Expert Panel. While this design might increase the amount of seepage to be treated, the Panel also noted: The Panel recognizes that creating dry tailings may increase the amount of water requiring treatment or storage. In the Panels opinion, the additional water treatment is more than compensated by the long-term stability achieved by maintaining the tailings in an unsaturated state. Upstream Dam Engineering As mentioned above, upstream-type dam construction is the most problematic type of tailings dam construction, and is associated with a majority of tailings dam accidents. Upstream dam construction has been banned as a dam construction practice in Chile as the result of the large number of seismic and other dam failures associated with this type of structure. Three noted experts on tailings dams published “The 10 Rules” for upstream tailings dams in 2002 Martin et al 2002). They note that: It is also important to note that these rules are not options and are not interchangeable with alternative concepts of soil mechanics. These rules exist based upon the fundamentals of soil behavior, the experience of numerous tailings dam failures and the experience of well-managed facilities that perform as intended. Of the 10 rules, a “score” of 9/10 will not necessarily have a better outcome than 2/10, as any omission creates immediate candidacy for an upstream tailings dam to join the list of facilities that have failed due to ignoring some or all of the rules. Rule number 2 is: 2. A sufficiently wide beach-above-water (BAW), relative to the ultimate height of the dam, must be maintained at all times, to achieve segregation of the coarser tailings sizes and to form a relatively strong, wide, drained (unsaturated), and/or dilatant (non-contractant during shear) outer shell. The dam slope must not be underlain by tailings slimes (beach-below water - BBW), unless the designer has satisfied Rule 4 below. (emphasis added) The shell must be of sufficient width to retain the “bursting pressures” (Casagrande and MacIvor, 1970) of the upstream contractant beach sands or slimes if they liquefy. They further emphasize: The rules for the design of an upstream constructed tailings dam are not optional guidelines for individual designers to randomly select components they can “fit” into their conception of a safe facility.

CSP2 has performed its own analysis of the possible underground mining, assuming an underground room & pillar mining cost of $44/ton for backfill, and $39/ton without backfill.1 We disagree with the assumption in AGP 2011 that the recovery rate for room & pillar mining would be limited to 55%. The method can be more flexible than that assumed by AGP. Mining methods tend have site-specific modifications that are made to make the method most flexible and productive at that site.

Dave Chambers,"Adaptive Management has many definitions, but for the purposes of mining it might be defined as “a structured, iterative process of robust decision making in the face of uncertainty, with an aim to reducing uncertainty over time via system monitoring (Wikipedia, Nov 2015).” PolyMet proposes to use Adaptive Management for a number of critical aspects of the proposed mining project. Adaptive management is proposed for Water Management (probably the most critical program), the Stockpile Cover System, the Mine and Plant Site Waste Water Treatment Systems, Tailings Basin Pond Bottom Cover System, Wetland Monitoring, the geotechnical stability of the Waste rock stockpiles, Tailings Basin, and Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility, the Mine and Plant Site Air Quality Management Plans, and Long-Term Post-Closure Monitoring and Maintenance. The US Department of Interior describes adaptive management as management as the interplay of decision and assessment components, in an iterative process of learning by doing and adapting based on what’s learned. Adaptive management involves key activities such as stakeholder engagement, resource monitoring, and modeling, none of which is sufficient by itself to make a decision process adaptive. The integration of these components is what defines an adaptive approach to natural resource management. (Williams and Brown 2012, p. 11) Simply monitoring activities and occasionally changing them when problems are discovered does not constitute adaptive management. The USGS notes that “Many people in the field of natural resource conservation now claim, sometimes wrongly, that adaptive management is the approach they use to manage resources (Failing et al. 2004). The current popularity of adaptive management is somewhat at odds with its rather modest record of documented success, a record based at least in part on an inadequate framing of many management problems, poorly designed monitoring, and incomplete implementation of the adaptive process itself. (Williams and Brown 2012, p. 6) This review seeks to distinguish adaptive management as a technical, substantive process from a generic definition of adaptation that encompasses lesser attempts to simply apply modifications to failed plans. While adaptive management may take many forms, to be genuine it should ensure a substantive mix of critical elements for planned and unplanned impacts that are applied over time. In the permit context, it should have clear prospective, prescriptive commitments to application and measurement. These should generally consider and include, but may not be limited to, defining and employing 1. Stakeholder involvement 2. Management objectives 3. Predictive models 4. Monitoring protocols 5. Decision making protocols 6. Follow-up monitoring 7. Assessment 8. Learning and feedback 9. Institutional learning for both the regulators and mines 10. Timing and costs associated with both the adaptive management and its implementation (success and failure) including post reclamation and post-bond release. (See generally Williams and Brown 2012) PolyMet proposed use of Adaptive Management is problematic because most of its applications do not include important features of adaptive management. Most of the proposed Adaptive Management Plans are in fact more akin to normal project management where project activities and plans are modified as necessary and appropriate based on changed conditions, failed activities, leaks, improvements in available technologies, etc. For example, PolyMet’s EIS Rock and Overburden Management Plan, Section 6.0, Reporting and Adaptive Management, states that Adaptive management is a system of management practices based on clearly defined outcomes and monitoring requirements to determine if management actions are meeting the desired outcomes and, if not, implementing changes that will best ensure that outcomes are met or re-evaluated. Adaptive management recognizes the uncertainty associated with estimates based on exploration drilling for a 20-year Mine Plan. Adaptive management measures will be developed through the Environmental Review process, permitting, and during operations, reclamation, and long-term closure to define when changes are needed. (PolyMet 2014h, p. 38) This seems to be a fairly self-evident definition of adaptive management – promising little more than modification of plans to implement changes in response to failure to meet previously committed outcomes. Adaptive management surely recognizes uncertainty (such as that uncertainty associated with estimates based on exploration drilling) but it requires a substantive process for dealing with that uncertainty and responding to the outcomes from that uncertainty on the ground. Much of the PolyMet plan does not commit to these steps or outcomes in terms of adaptive management – rather it commits to develop adaptive steps in the future. To be properly considered by regulators and the public, these steps should be included at the permitting stage – not as the mine, and its failures, unfold. Adaptive management can be a functional iterative tool for many situations but it could also be misused/misapplied as a means to delay planning or other steps necessary for a complete mine and reclamation plan - both of which are necessary prior to agency approval of a mining permit. The USFS (USDA 2005) has noted “adaptive management does not postpone action until “enough” is known, but acknowledges that time and resources are too short to defer some action” (Lee 1999, p. 5) Specific examples of these types of deficiencies include, but are not limited, to the following sections.

Dave Chambers,"5.2.4.2.2 Transportation and Utility Corridor Indirect Effects The FEIS analyzes the effect of spillage & blowoff as dust effects to vegetation (Section 5.2.4.2.1) and potential air quality impacts (minimal – Section 5.2.74.2). However, the primary concern for ore scattered along the transportation corridor is on water quality. At the Flambeau mine a small stream located next to the now-closed ore loading terminal is still contaminated with copper from non-point sources. This contamination is most probably related to dust blowoff from the ore trains, since copper is elevated in the entire sub-drainage (Chambers and Zamzow 2009). According to the FEIS, the ore trains would travel on a: ... railroad, which would generally be used to transport ore from the Mine Site to the Plant Site using three to four trains, each consisting of sixteen to twenty 100-ton, side-dumping ore cars ... (Section 3.2.2.2.4 Use During Operations, p. 3-85, emphasis added) The amount of ore spillage was originally estimated to be 6.14 tons per year for unrefurbished cars (PolyMet 2015q). However, after reworking the door hinges, PolyMet estimates the amount of spillage can be reduced 95% (PolyMet 2014a).

Dave Chambers,"5.2.4.2.2 Transportation and Utility Corridor Indirect Effects The FEIS analyzes the effect of spillage & blowoff as dust effects to vegetation (Section 5.2.4.2.1) and potential air quality impacts (minimal – Section 5.2.74.2). However, the primary concern for ore scattered along the transportation corridor is on water quality. At the Flambeau mine a small stream located next to the now-closed ore loading terminal is still contaminated with copper from non-point sources. This contamination is most probably related to dust blowoff from the ore trains, since copper is elevated in the entire sub-drainage (Chambers and Zamzow 2009). According to the FEIS, the ore trains would travel on a: ... railroad, which would generally be used to transport ore from the Mine Site to the Plant Site using three to four trains, each consisting of sixteen to twenty 100-ton, side-dumping ore cars ... (Section 3.2.2.2.4 Use During Operations, p. 3-85, emphasis added) The amount of ore spillage was originally estimated to be 6.14 tons per year for unrefurbished cars (PolyMet 2015q). However, after reworking the door hinges, PolyMet estimates the amount of spillage can be reduced 95% (PolyMet 2014a).

Dave Chambers,"It was noted earlier in the FEIS that: The inclusion of relatively large zones of finer-grained tailings within this outer shell reduces the drainage ability of the shell, increasing the phreatic surface, and reduces the localized shear strength due to the generally weaker behavior of the finer-grained tailings. There were instances during the operation of the LTVSMC Tailings Basin where significant amounts of fine tailings and slimes settled near the perimeter dams. (4.2.14.2.2 Development of the Existing LTVSMC Tailings Basin, p. 4-427) It is proposed to use Cement Deep Soil Mix (CDSM), and other measures like drains, to stabilize the tailings in order to allow upstream dam construction to continue. Also noted in the FEIS is that the geometry and physical changes to the embankments (such as CDSM) were incorporated into the design so that all computed slope stability Factors of Safety met or exceeded the Factors of Safety required by the NorthMet Geotechnical Modeling Work Plan (PolyMet 2015l, Attachment A). It is also noted in the Geotechnical Data Package for the Tailing Basin (PolyMet 2015l) that: The appropriate approach hinges on the extent, composition and continuity of stringers within the deposit as subsequently described. Several types of evidence support the conclusion that heterogeneity within the deposits is localized, so widespread and continuous stringers of the weakest material (slimes) are unlikely and isotropic parameters are appropriate. (PolyMet 2015l, p. 63, emphasis added) This is a necessary assumption for time-efficient modeling. It is also a critical assumption in terms of keeping the costs of the modeling task in a reasonable range. However, if this assumption is wrong, even in relatively local regions of the dams, then the modeling is wrong. To illustrate the complexity of the tailings near and under the dam structures, Figure 5.2.14-6 for cross section F of the tailings basin, the most critical cross section in terms of potential instability. Cross Section F, which intersects the northern dam of Cell 2E, as shown in Figure 5.2.14-4, was selected to represent the critical cross section for stability analysis purposes as it is the maximum section based on height as measured from the downstream toe to the proposed final crest, some layers of the weaker fine tailings and slimes extend close to the dam, and the original starter dam is underlain by peat. (FEIS, p. 5-657) The dam in the area of Cross Section F (see Figure 5.2.14.6 on the following page) will also require underdrains in order to provide long-term stability (PolyMet 2015l, p. 73). This building complexity only raises the chances for misinterpretation and oversimplification in the modeling. Simpler models are better. The Cement Deep Soil Mix columns are designed to provide more weight bearing capacity in the tailings to attempt to justify further upstream-type dam construction.

Of note is that all of the cross section views of the CDSM the top of the CDSM Zone terminates before the top of the LTVSMC tailings, and bottoms in glacial till, not bedrock.

Dave Chambers,"One of the critical design parameters for the Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility is maintaining the integrity of the liner system. PolyMet plans on building the Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility on top of multiple layers of tailings and peat (see Figure 5.2.14-9). In order to stabilize the underlying material PolyMet is proposing to: • Install wick drains (if required); and • Place, monitor, and remove a preload fill in the existing LTVSMC Emergency Basin to preconsolidate existing material, thereby reducing future anticipated settlements to mitigate the potential future strains. (FEIS, p. 5-662) A preload would be placed on the existing LTVSMC Emergency Basin to consolidate the foundation materials before construction of the Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility. Wick drains may be used to help accelerate the consolidation time by increasing the effective hydraulic conductivity of the tailings due to decrease in flowpath length. Some portion of this load would be removed before construction, and the remaining material would be graded to provide sufficient drainage slope and provide a suitable foundation material for the facility. The material would rebound a small amount after the preload is removed. The aggregate settlement at a representative location within the Emergency Basin, considering the maximum anticipated tailings thickness in the foundation, is computed to be 3.9 ft. The material at this location is modeled to consolidate an additional 1.4 ft by the end of operations of the Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility. (emphasis added) ... Strain in the Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility liner system would result from differential settlement in the facility foundation between points along the liner.

A less technologically demanding, and safer, method of insuring the stability of the foundation of the Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility is to remove the problematic material down to bedrock. The material removed could be placed in the tailings basin, and not only would the subgrade be stable, but more room for hydrometallurgical residue would be gained. In the case of the Hydrometallurgical Residue Facility placing the liner on the granite bedrock is possible.

The choice of a 2,475-year return design earthquake is not adequate for a structure that must hold in perpetuity. The Maximum Credible Earthquake, not the 2,475-year return event – which is significantly less than an Maximum Credible Earthquake – should be used for the design event for all permanent structures, both dams and waste rock. The Maximum Credible Earthquake is recommended to be a 10,000-year return period earthquake (ICOLD 2001).

Daniel Pauly,"The errors and omissions in the Tailings Basin dataset have permeated the FEIS (as they had with the SDEIS) and its supporting reports, resulting in incorrect fundamental conclusions as to current and future mercury discharges at the Tailings Basin and Waste Water Treatment Plant.

Daniel Pauly,"In view of the data integrity issues and improper mercury discharge conclusions, the NorthMet FEIS should review previously discarded Tailings Basin alternatives.",ALT,NS,X,1,
Daniel Pauly,"The Tailings Basin has four active NPDES monitoring locations that are positioned to intercept Tailings Basin seepage. NorthMet documents state that these monitoring locations provide the best data for determining Tailings Basin discharges. Inexplicably, the FEIS relies almost exclusively only on data from one of these discharge locations – the one that appears to show seepage below 1.3 ng/L. All three of the other discharge locations, including one that is better positioned relative to the likely flow of NorthMet discharges, were essentially ignored. The result is an improperly skewed assessment that mercury levels will be lower than 1.3 ng/L. Correction of this error shows mercury discharges above 1.3 ng/L. 2. Looking beyond NPDES monitoring sites, a comprehensive review of mercury seepage data collected over time at the Tailings Basin also shows that Tailings Basin seepage will exceed Great Lakes Initiative mercury levels of 1.3 ng/L. Despite the availability of this information, it is essentially ignored in the FEIS.",WAT,S,O,3,FEIS Table 4.2.2-29 and 4.2.2-33. DS006 is not expected to be impacted by the Proposed Project.
Daniel Pauly,"The FEIS also relies upon a faulty mercury sequestration test that predicts remarkably low mercury levels in Tailings Basin seepage, while ignoring a superior test that does not predict significant sequestration. Specifically, the FEIS gives great weight to a very flawed 8 hour experiment with NorthMet tailings in a flask, while never even mentioning in the FEIS a much more comprehensive test prepared for the NorthMet site that showed mercury levels are likely to be significantly above Great Lakes Initiative standards.",MERC,S,N,8,Research is available noting decreased mercury concentrations from taconite tailings in field measurements.

Daniel Pauly,The FEIS includes an “Assessment of Existing Pond Water and Groundwater Quality at the Tailings Basin” that shows mercury seepage at nearly six times the Great Lakes standard for mercury discharges. This result is inexplicably not discussed further in the FEIS.,WAT,NS,X,1,
Daniel Pauly,A combination of errors and faulty analysis cause the FEIS to erroneously conclude that Tailings Basin mercury discharges will be below 1.3 ng/L. These errors result in numerous misstatements and faulty conclusions in the FEIS. Two of these deficiencies lead to notable flaws: 1) failure to design and test a Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) that will adequately determine viability of mercury removal;,PD,NS,X,1,
Daniel Pauly,"2) design of a discharge capture system that incorporates a wetland that will receive the majority of the mercury and sulfate from the Tailings Basin, and which will meaningful increase mercury contamination in the Embarrass River watershed.",PD,NS,X,1,
Daniel Pauly,"The WWTP will use reverse osmosis to remove contamination from Tailings Basin seepage. The FEIS discusses a pilot test for the WWTP that was conducted in 2012. Unfortunately, the WWTP pilot test never evaluated mercury removal using reverse osmosis. In fact, as the Pilot Test report itself states, the WWTP designers don’t know how much mercury can be removed by the WWTP. The report states that maybe as little as 20 percent, or maybe as much as 99 percent, of mercury might be removed. One guestimate is given by a salesperson for PolyMet’s membrane manufacturer of “about 70 percent” for mercury removal. Even then, according to the FEIS documents, removal of methylmercury does not appear possible using the planned WWTP design. In other words, removal of the most hazardous species of mercury, the one that bio accumulates in fish and humans, has not even been considered in the WWTP design.",PD,S,N,12,FEIS Section 5.2.2.3.4. PolyMet 2015q App. F
Daniel Pauly,"The FEIS seeks to address these concerns with a proposed “adaptive engineering” approach for the WWTP design and operation. An “adaptive engineering” approach is inconsistent with best practices in the literature for removal of contaminants using reverse osmosis, because each location and system has unique problems and challenges. Due to the relatively complex design of the NorthMet project water flows, including significant seasonal variations of likely methylmercury flows, the WWTP will need to remove disparate contaminants from quite variable influent streams. By approaching critical issues and long term challenges with an adaptive engineering approach, the NorthMet project risks decades of uncertainty, contaminant release violations, and unforeseen costs because the analysis will be undertaken long after the mine is in operation, and some of analysis won’t be undertaken until after the mine is closed. This approach fails to provide decision makers with adequate information to assess what the treatment costs will be. For example, it is possible that mercury removal alone could add significant costs to WWTP as currently envisioned, because the various species of mercury are removed by different types of technology. Inexplicably, the WWTP and Pilot Test never even consider mercury removal as an issue, and so no site-specific costs for mercury removal can be calculated.",WAT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes PD 06, MERC 15, WR 137; PolyMet 2015d"
Daniel Pauly,"The second problem that has been overlooked relates to changes in the NorthMet proposed Tailings Basin since the DEIS was prepared. Specifically, the currently proposed NorthMet Tailings Basin has been modified since the DEIS to create a containment system outside of the Tailings Basin. The containment system will include an up to 160 acre wetland that will be receiving the mercury and sulfate laden waters from the combined LTV/NorthMet tailings. These seepage flows will increase relative to the current LTV tailings basin, and create a much larger wetland than currently exists. The NorthMet project’s own model data shows in great detail that most mercury and sulfate will be delivered directly to this wetland, and not to the containment system drains.",PD,NS,X,1,
Daniel Pauly,"Contemporary research, including important research recently conducted in Minnesota, shows that this wetland, with its mixture of mercury, sulfate, and organic matter, is a prime environment for methylation of mercury. In fact, recent research by government investigators in Minnesota in the last few years has shown shockingly high levels of methylmercury in wetlands, including methylmercury spikes at the toe of taconite tailing basins. The FEIS never asks what will happen to that methylmercury. It is likely that some of it is going to be carried to the WWTP, but as the WWTP pilot test itself reports, there is no plan for removing it. What happens to the rest of the methylmercury, which might be the majority? Current research shows it will be absorbed by everything from mosquitos to earthworms, and will then travel up the food chain throughout the Embarrass River watershed.",MERC,S,N,12,"In preparing the FEIS, the Co-lead Agencies concluded that a quantification of methylmercury and its subsequent bioaccumulation cannot be made, given the limitations of today’s scientific understanding of the complex processes contributing to methylation of mercury in the environment and introduction into fish tissue. The analysis in the FEIS acknowledges this scientific uncertainty. Methylmercury produced in wetlands is not necessarily incorporated into food chains and concentrated to levels of concern. The potential small incremental addition of mercury to wetlands from the NorthMet Project Proposed Action is within the variability of background deposition estimates and is not expected to have any measurable effect on the mercury methylation process in wetlands in the NorthMet Project Proposed Action area. The Co- lead Agencies acknowledge that there could be water quality effects on wetlands and propose a comprehensive monitoring approach during operations, reclamation, and closure to identify such effects (if any). If effects are identified, adaptive mitigation measures would be invoked to remediate the situation and assure that water quality standards are met."
Daniel Pauly,"As detailed in the attached comments, and previously raised in my SDEIS comments, the present plan for the NorthMet Tailings Basin is to reuse LTV’s 60 year old unlined tailings basin that contains decades of heavy mercury loadings. The existing LTV tailings basin has been drying out since 2001, and seepage volumes have declined. As noted in the FEIS with reference to the No Action Alternative, the LTV tailings basin should continue to dry out in coming years, with a concurrent drop in contaminated discharges. The NorthMet recommended action is to essentially build another unlined Tailings Basin on top of the current unlined and inactive tailing basin, but this time with tailings that are likely to be higher in sulfates than the existing mercury-rich tailings. Water from the new Tailings Basin will seep through the old taconite tailings, and then be discharged out the bottom into a large wetland area. In the wetland mercury methylation is likely to occur, and the methylmercury will bio-accumulate in the wetland life forms, before being carried out into the Embarrass River watershed by everything from bugs to birds. Some of the mercury, whether methylated or not, will travel to the NorthMet proposal Waste Water Treatment Plant. However, the FEIS has no plan to remove that mercury, and the FEIS documents indicate removal may not even be possible with the reverse osmosis technology planned for the waste water treatment plant. In view of the information available, two alternatives, at a minimum, should have been considered more thoroughly to see if they could have avoided the problems of perching a new unlined basin on top of an old unlined basin: either (a) putting a liner between the basins; or (b) locating the new basin somewhere other than on top of an old unlined basin. Both of these alternatives offer significant improvements in regards to preventing release of mercury from the existing LTV tailings basin, avoid the interaction of seepage water between two different types of tailings, and allow for what will likely be a significantly less complex and less expensive waste water treatment facility. These two proposals would require a much more significant up-front capital cost, but would reduce long term costs and accompanying uncertainty. To the extent long term costs are an issue to project approval, consideration of these options should be undertaken to remove that uncertainty. Overall, it seems quite possible that either of these two options could offer the mutual benefit of lower costs and improved environmental protection. These two alternatives were dismissed very early in the EIS process. From my review of the DEIS and FEIS, I believe these alternatives were prematurely dismissed because DEIS and FEIS preparers overlooked the fact that that mercury contamination would be an issue. The thorough review of these (and other) alternatives is obviously beyond the scope of these comments. However, at the end of these comments I provide a simplified matrix showing how these two alternatives compare in effectiveness and cost relative to the proposals in the FEIS. Further note that viable implementation of either of these options is really only available now, before the NorthMet project proceeds, because neither can be “retrofitted” onto the project once it has gone forward. In other words, it will be too late in 10 or 20 years, once the Tailings Basin has been filled, to find out that there might have been a better and cheaper way. Should the “adaptive engineering” approach to the WWTP prove unworkable for long term water treatment, it will be too late, or at least unfathomably expensive, to segregate the NorthMet tailings and LTV tailings.",ALT,S,O,4,SDEIS Theme ALT 10; PolyMet 2015d Section 4.2.4.3.1
Daniel Pauly,"Mercury is one of the most significant potential water contaminants from the NorthMet Project. Contamination of local surface and groundwater from the Tailings Basin is of particular concern. As noted in the FEIS, the proposed NorthMet Tailings Basin will have significant levels of water seepage indefinitely, and the volume of discharge water will be increasing significantly compared to current conditions. The level of mercury in that seepage water is critical to evaluating the environmental impacts of the NorthMet project, as well as the financial viability of seeking to remove the mercury.",MERC,NS,X,1,
Daniel Pauly,"Table 4.2.2-4 was prepared using information in SDEIS and FEIS appendix Barr 2006f, which I received from Ms. Lisa Fay of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Barr 2006f allows for reconstruction of the mercury contamination calculations for each of these sample locations. Despite the fact that Barr 2006f includes significant errors, it is still relied upon in the FEIS. In reviewing the data in Barr 2006f, I identified a fundamental mistake in the summary results: The calculations had a major error because the sample data was presented in two units: nanograms per liter (ng/L) and micrograms per liter (ug/l), yet the calculations ignored these different units. I pointed out this error in my SDEIS comments, but it is clear that the drafters of the FEIS did not consider this issue, and clearly did not correct it. Reproduced below is a portion of page 113 of Barr 2006f, showing the table heading for columns of mercury discharge data for Cell 1E: Data in the left hand column is presented in ng/L, while data in the right hand column is presented as ug/L. For reference, the data on the right can be expressed as “<200 ng/L”. Unfortunately, the FEIS preparers interpreted this data as “<.2 ng/L”. What was being expressed in the right hand column is that the minimum detection level (mdl) for these samples was less than 200 ng/L. In other words, the analysis did not seek to measure low level mercury concentrations. The problem is that the FEIS preparers thought that the data indicated a minimum detection level of 0.2 ng/L. In other words, the SDEIS and FEIS preparers incorrectly thought this data indicated mercury levels were spectacularly low.",MERC,S,N,8,"The comment correctly observes that mercury concentration units were not converted to ng/L (which they should have been) to produce Final EIS Table 4.2.2-4. DNR subsequently converted the mercury data and re-evaluated the resulting data set. After this correction, mercury levels still remain below the GLI standard of 1.3 ng/L. DNR believes that this correction does not materially affect the characterization of mercury concentrations in the Tailings Basin. SDEIS Theme MERC 01, WR 018"
Daniel Pauly,"Not only is the mean total mercury concentration incorrect in Table 4.2.2-4 FEIS, but it is important to note that FEIS Table 4.2.2-4 also dramatically overestimates the number of non-detect samples for mercury. The error is that the minimum detection levels were far above the actual Great Lakes Initiative levels, so a non-detect in many cases means only that the mercury levels were below the very high 200 ng/L, rather than a modern detection level of 0.5 ng/L. Non-detects for such high minimum detection levels should not be considered to be non-detects when the regulated target level for mercury is 1.3 ng/L. I pointed out this exact problem with regard to the SDEIS, but the drafters of the FEIS appear to have entirely ignored my comment because no changes or corrections have been made. The problem is that someone reviewing Table 4.2.2-4 would mistakenly conclude that the number of samples with detectable levels of mercury was very, very low. This presentation of the data is profoundly misleading, because in fact almost all of those non-detects came from analysis that had very high minimum detection levels. A person reviewing Table 4.2.2-4 is likely to be misinformed about the data, and reach the erroneous conclusion that almost all of the samples at the ten sample locations were below a modern detection level of 0.5 ng/L.",MERC,S,N,12,SDEIS Theme MERC 04
Daniel Pauly,"The NorthMet Tailings Basin assessment improperly underestimates mercury discharges by disregarding data from three out of four of the NPDES monitored surface discharge locations at the Tailings Basin. In addition to the erroneous calculation with regard to water quality at numerous Tailings Basin locations, the FEIS has improperly selected a subset of NPDES water sampling locations that has also resulted in a meaningfully inaccurate assessment of current conditions at the Tailings Basin. The Tailings Basin has four active seeps that have been monitored since the closing of the LTV plant site. In the PolyMet water quality analysis, which is an appendix to the FEIS, PolyMet’s water quality scientists state that “NPDES surface discharges from the Tailings Basin serve as the best proxy for concentrations of mercury seepage from the existing Tailings Basin”. PolyMet 2013j at page 271. SD006 is in the southeast corner of the Tailings Basin, SD001, SD004, and SD005 are in the northwest corner of the Tailings Basin; and SD002 is in the north central portion of the Tailings Basin. There was apparently never an SD003, so there is no data. Also, SD005 has essentially been dry and not sampled for most of the last 13 years. That leaves four NPDES sample locations to review: SD001, SD002, SD004, and SD006 consistent with the opinion of PolyMet’s water model that these discharges are the best proxy for concentrations of mercury seepage from the existing Tailings Basin”. Despite the fact that this seepage data is so critical to assessing mercury contamination, only Tailing Basin data from SD004 is used to support the determination that mercury levels will be below Great Lakes levels. This was a clear error in the SDEIS, and the error has been carried forward in the FEIS. SD0026, which is at the plant site and not the Tailings Basin, is also used, but it gives no indication of likely Tailings Basin discharges. In fact, it is not located in the Embarrass River watershed like the Tailings Basin. In order to evaluate whether this single sampling point should be the primary empirical assessment of groundwater conditions, I obtained NPDES sampling data from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for all four of the Tailings Basin NPDES surface discharges. I then evaluated total mercury in the Tailings Basin for each of these sample locations, but with more up to date information through 2006 to be consistent with most FEIS data sets. Based upon this MPCA data, I calculated total mercury levels for each of the four NPDES locations, plus average of all samples regardless of which location was sampled (basically a weighted average), and further an average of the four sites (basically a weighted average). My spreadsheets with calculations are available upon request, but should be easily reproducible without them because the data is readily available from the MPCA. My results are provided graphically below, and are also summarized in the accompanying table. The graph indicates that rather than SD004 being a representative sample of conditions at the NorthMet Tailings basin, SD004 is an outlier – the one location that isn’t above the Great Lakes standard of 1.3 ng/L. All three of the other locations were above Great Lakes standards, as were averages weighted by sample number and location.",WAT,S,O,3,FEIS Table 4.2.2-29 and 4.2.2-33.

Daniel Pauly,"No matter how the samples are interpreted, it is clear that the FEIS has a profound shortcoming in relying almost exclusively on data from SD004 as a supposedly “representative” sampling location. SD004 is not representative of water discharges at the Tailings Basin, but rather is an anomaly. The unfortunate decision by FEIS preparers to select SD004 as foundation of the Tailings Basin mercury analysis results in flawed arguments, erroneous conclusions, and unexamined Project alternatives.",MERC,NS,X,1,
Daniel Pauly,"Different conclusions on mercury concentrations at SD004 in the DEIS and FEIS reveal the problem of over reliance on a narrow subset of discharge data: The over-reliance on just a small set of data points, especially from just one or two locations at the Tailings Basin, is problematic because a change in just a couple of samples can completely change the results, and lead to completely different actions. A good example of this statistical phenomena can be demonstrated by looking at how NPDES surface discharge SD004 lead to completely different conclusions between the DEIS and the FEIS. Reproduced below are Table 4.1.31 from the original DEIS, and Table 4.2.2-4 from the FEIS. These two tables show the same datasets for 11 sample locations at the Tailings Basin. Note that almost every location has very similar results between the DEIS and FEIS (with the exception of some errors in the FEIS, mentioned earlier). The one exception to this consistency is SD004, where the mean has gone from 1.9 ng/L from 15 samples in the DEIS, to a mean of 1.2 from 14 samples in the FEIS. I highlighted in red the DEIS data for SD004, which is above the Great Lakes Initiative level; and highlighted in green the FEIS data for SD004, which is below the Great Lakes Initiative level. How can the averages be so radically different? It appears, from the limited data I was able to independently obtain from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, that one or two of the samples in the DEIS was considered to be erroneous, and corrected in the FEIS.",MERC,NS,X,1,

Daniel Pauly,"As explained at page 4-126 of the FEIS, the assessment summarized on Table 4.2.2-23 is useful to show the effect of passage of water seeping through the Tailings Basin. The first paragraph of Page 4-111 states as follows: Comparing existing pond water quality with water quality at the toe of the Tailings Basin helps define the effect passage through the existing LTVSMC tailings has on seepage water quality. Based on the parameters that were monitored in the Cell 2E pond, it appears that passage through the LTVSMC tailings reduces the average concentrations of arsenic, fluoride, and molybdenum, although it is difficult to determine to what extent these reductions are simply attributable to the effects of dilution. The concentrations of several other parameters, such as calcium, manganese, nickel, and TDS, increase as they seep from the tailings pond to the toe of the Tailings Basin. The preparers of the FEIS commented on how calcium, TDS, and manganese all increased when passing through the Tailings Basin; and how fluoride, arsenic, and molybdenum go down. However, there is no mention or analysis whatsoever of the most significant data point: mercury has gone from 1.4 ng/L in pond water to 4.9 ng/L after passing through the Tailings Basin.2 I have highlighted these respective contaminants in yellow, green and red. These results should considered in the FEIS, because they directly conflict with the conclusions that mercury is not a contaminant of concern at the NorthMet Tailings Basin. nan",MERC,S,N,8,"A simple arithmetic comparison of means does not represent the processes impacting mercury concentrations as water flows through the tailings: the mean well data are from a different time period (2007 - 2013) than the mean pond data (2001 - 2004), and therefore a direct relationship between the two cannot be drawn. The well data also represent greater temporal coverage, including measurements from a greater number of years and seasons, than do the pond data and thus encompass a greater range of variability. The values measured in the Cell 2E pond (3 samples from 0.7 to 3.6 ng/L) fall within the range of values measured in the toe wells (72 samples from <0.5 to 153 ng/L), and both groups of samples have median (50th percentile) values of 1.0 ng/L. As described by several researchers (Helsel 2011; EPA 2009; Reimann et al. 2008), the median is often a better descriptor of environmental data sets than is a mean value because a small number of data points can skew the mean to be larger while most of the data points are less than the mean value. Therefore, although more extreme values, including several particularly high outliers, were measured in the wells, overall measurements do not suggest a difference in concentration between the Cell 2E Pond and the seepage water at the toe of the Tailings Basin. It should also be noted that the pond sampling for mercury occurred from 4 to 11 years before the toe well sampling and, depending on hydrologic properties of the tailings, may not represent the starting pond composition of the water collected in the toe wells, and the simple comparison being made is implying a relationship between the data when there may be none because of the different"
Daniel Pauly,"The FEIS relies upon a faulty mercury sequestration test that predicts remarkably low mercury levels in Tailings Basin seepage, while ignoring a superior test that does not predict significant sequestration. At numerous points in the FEIS and supporting documents, reference is made to a bench study conducted by NTS in 2006 that purports to show “[T]he concentration of dissolved mercury in a treatment flask containing process water and NorthMet tailings decreased from 3.3 ng/L to 0.9 ng/L over an eight hour period.” FEIS at page 5-229, As discussed below, this test had obvious flaws and glaring mischaracterization of the collected data. In contrast, the FEIS entirely fails to even mention that a second carefully designed mercury sequestration test was performed. This test concluded that there was no observable diminishment when mercury- laden water passed through the simulated LTV/NorthMet tailings combination. If anything, the test showed a slight increase in mercury levels. This thorough study, despite having tremendous potential to quantify likely mercury discharges from the combined Tailings Basin, is never so much as mentioned at any point in the FEIS itself. This is a situation where a very low- quality test with favorable results was prominently presented in the FEIS, while a high-quality test with unfavorable results was not even mentioned. In view of the fact that mercury is the most serious contaminant in the St. Louis River watershed to public health, the basis of this important research warrants further examination. The tests are also important because the level at which the Tailings Basin discharges mercury affects numerous other conclusions and design choices, in particular a large number of alternatives that should be considered if mercury will be leaching from the NorthMet Tailings at levels above 1.3 ng/L.",MERC,S,N,8,Research is available noting decreased mercury concentrations from taconite tailings in field measurements.

Daniel Pauly,"6.3 The SRK test that showed no mercury sequestration should have been included in the FEIS, because it is on its face far more probative than the NTS eight hour test. The NorthMet FEIS asserts that one of the fundamental long-term mechanisms for mercury control at the NorthMet Tailings Basin is removal of mercury by the pre-existing LTV taconite tailings. This mechanism is relied upon repeatedly in the FEIS itself, as well as the supporting documents. This mechanism was also proposed in the original DEIS, but was objected to as lacking scientific integrity by the EPA, which requested that further analysis be provided to support this mercury removal mechanism. See page 11 of the “EPA Detailed Comments to the NorthMet Project DEIS”. Despite the EPA’s express request for further support of this theory, the FEIS fails to provide further support, and merely restates the previously challenged analysis.

Daniel Pauly,"Efforts to reduce atmospheric precipitation, especially from coal burning sources, will likely diminish background mercury loading dramatically in coming years, leaving the NorthMet Tailings Basin as a larger relative source of mercury to the Embarrass River and St. Louis River watersheds. At the present time significant mercury loading into the Embarrass River and St. Louis River watersheds occurs as a result of atmospheric deposition, much of it from coal plants. In fact, an estimated 70 percent of atmospheric mercury deposition in Minnesota comes from anthropogenic sources, including burning coal and improper disposal of fluorescent lights. Efforts are underway in Minnesota, the broader United States, and outside the U.S. to reduce mercury emissions. Reductions in coal burning will likely lead to significant reductions even in the near term as increasing amounts of electricity generation switches from coal to natural gas. It is likely that atmospheric mercury deposition reductions will continue for many decades, and the amount of atmospheric deposition of mercury in the Embarrass River will decline. What may not decline, due to the tremendous amounts of mercury now held within the existing tailings basin at the NorthMet site, is the amount of mercury discharged from the Tailings Basin in coming centuries. Without adequate efforts to prevent mercury seepage and release at the Tailings Basin, the likely result will be a circumstance where in coming decades and centuries the NorthMet project becomes a larger and larger share of mercury contamination in the Embarrass River and St. Louis River watersheds.",AIR,S,O,8,SDEIS Section 6.2.6.4.3

There is essentially nothing in between. TDS and Total Hardness fluctuate on the same days, but at different ratios that are closer to 200 percent.

Daniel Pauly,"The RO membranes that best remove mercury also have unacceptably low system recovery rates. A Supplemental Comprehensive WWTP Pilot Test is also necessary because PolyMet’s own literature review shows that even if an RO membrane can remove mercury, it may not do it with adequate system recovery. Specifically, the Final Pilot Testing Report includes Table 29, which shows a summary of Metals Removal Literature Review Summary. Note that mercury removal is reported to be greater than 98 percent in Reference 16, but the system recovery is just 50 percent, which means that only about half the water is recovered as permeate, with a very high volume of high-mercury retentate. Even this is measured only using a pilot level test. These issues, such as rejection rate and system recovery are non-trivial, and can dramatically impact long term performance and cost of mercury removal. For example, if system recover rates are low, a two-phase system might be needed, which would significantly increase capital and operating costs. Alternatively, it may be necessary to have different systems for mercury removal and sulfate removal if a single treatment system cannot be found that adequately removes both contaminants. In summary, we simply do not have enough information to evaluate a multi- century waste water treatment plant, either from a technical or financial point of view. A comprehensive pilot test should be performed, and it should be directed both to technical viability, as well as financial predictions. In view of the known seasonal variations in contaminant streams (see, e.g., report of Michael Berndt discussed below, showing large seasonal fluctuations in methyl mercury discharges at the toe of a taconite tailings basin), I recommend that such test run for at least from the start of one summer through the end of a following summer.",MERC,S,N,8,"Mercury removal would be a function of membrane treatment (RO or similarly performing technology), greensand filtration pre-treatment, and potentially other systems.

Daniel Pauly,"The WWTP Pilot Test report also indicates serious flaws in the sulfate pilot testing. In an earlier comment I expressed serious concern over the integrity of the data set from the WWTP Pilot Test. The reported influent levels for sulfate concentrations show that error was introduced into sample collection and/or analysis process. The error seems to be on the order of 400 percent, but isn’t clear if influent levels have been overstated by 400 percent or understated by 400 percent. In other words, no one really knows what the influent sulfate levels were. In addition, just as alarming, is the potential that the effluent results may have the same errors, or even other unidentified errors. This is not a trivial question, in particular because the final step of water treatment, VSEP process, had permeate level reported to be above 10 mg/l, and about 6 to 60 mg/l. See Figure 12 of the WWTP Pilot Test report. So, should those levels be 24 to 240 mg/L? Or maybe they should be about 1.5 to 15 mg/l. Preparers of the FEIS should review sample records, analytical data, and related material to ascertain the accuracy and integrity of the data set.",WAT,S,N,8,"Sulfate removal would be a function of membrane treatment (RO or similarly performing technology), chemical precipitation, and potentially other systems.

Daniel Pauly,"A Comprehensive WWTP Pilot Test should be conducted in a manner that provides meaningful information as to likely costs. As noted above, the WWTP Pilot test failed to even look at mercury as a substance to be removed from the NorthMet site, and also failed to even properly monitor sulfate levels in the influent. Other contaminants, such as aluminum, were also not properly analyzed during the Pilot Test. The need for a supplemental WWTP pilot test is clear from a technical viability standpoint, but is also necessary from a financial viability standpoint. The RO literature is clear that each site is different, and the costs of systems really can’t be estimated with insufficient information about feed water and likely membrane performance. A good example of that information is a 2013 Report from the U.S. Department Of Energy entitled Reverse Osmosis Optimization (available from comment author upon request), which states as follows: The cost of optimizing an RO system is influenced by many parameters that are specific to the application and operation of the system, such as feed water quality, membrane type, system configuration, and purity requirements. Therefore, to determine the costs and financial benefits of optimization options, the financial analysis must take into account the site-specific nature of the technology. Reverse Osmosis Optimization, by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, page 19 (emphasis added). These are non-trivial issues for which the FEIS contains inadequate information, which is quite problematic for a WWTP that is expected to process 630,000 gallons per day of water for hundreds of years.",WAT,S,N,8,"Mercury removal would be a function of membrane treatment (RO or similarly performing technology), greensand filtration pre-treatment, and potentially other systems.

Daniel Pauly,"The FEIS incorrectly states that the Pilot-testing has indicated that treated effluent from the Plant Site would meet water quality standards for all regulated constituents. As discussed above, the WWTP Pilot Test did not determine whether mercury would be removed by the WWTP. The FEIS should be updated to reflect this fact. A partial list of suggestions is provided below: 14.1 Table 5.2.2-29 should be modified to include mercury as a target. Table 5.2.2-28 provides the WWTF preliminary water quality targets. Mercury is not included but should have been included. After mercury is added as a target effluent, design of the WWTF should be evaluated for mercury removal, and a review should be made of FEIS analysis and conclusions that presumed mercury did not need a WWTF water quality target. This review should include evaluation of alternatives that were prematurely eliminated. 14.2 Page 5-147 should be modified to clarify that mercury removal was not tested in the pilot plant. Suitable language could include: “Table 5.2.2-29 presents the target WWTF effluent concentrations for the different mine phases. Pilot-testing of a WWTF with RO demonstrated that all of the target closure effluent concentrations could be achieved with the planned WWTF design, with the possible exception of mercury, for which no pilot testing has been undertaken and for which significant disagreements exist on viability of removal by RO processes.” 14.3 Page 5-226 of the FEIS should be amended to include statements from the Pilot Plant Test that removal of mercury using RO technology is uncertain. Potential language to consider is: “It should be noted that the West Pit overflow would be treated by the WWTF using RO technology prior to discharge, and the RO process is known to remove mercury. However, as indicated in the Pilot Test Report, there are disagreements in the literature about how much mercury can be removed, and the most dangerous form of mercury (methylmercury) has been reported as unremovable using RO methods.” 14.4 Table 5.2.2-51 should be modified to provide correct information of estimated mercury concentration of the combined inflows to the Plant Site WWTP Table 5.2.2-51 describes Mercury Concentration from Tailings Basin seepage water and Runoff (not interacting with tailings) to be 1.0 ng/L, which is below Great Lakes standard levels. In fact, mercury levels for these two sources will likely be higher than these estimated levels. NorthMet FEIS Comment – Daniel Pauly – Page 42 Correcting this error is essential because these two sources of inflows are expected to account for over 80 percent of the water inflows into the WWTP, and will impact feasibility and design of the WWTP, as well as long term costs to operate the WWTP.",MERC,S,N,8,"Mercury removal would be a function of membrane treatment (RO or similarly performing technology), greensand filtration pre-treatment, and potentially other systems.

Daniel Pauly,"The FEIS proposes a perimeter wetland that will receive sulfate and mercury, and has the potential to lead to significant methylmercury production and transport into the Embarrass River watershed. One of the most significant changes in the Tailings Basin since the DEIS was prepared is a proposal to construct a perimeter cutoff wall and drainage system around the north and west sides of the Tailings Basin. The objective of capturing discharges from the Tailings Basin has merit, but the proposed plan is seriously flawed because the cutoff wall and drain pipe are set back over 250 feet from the edge of the Tailings Basin, so as to form a large perimeter wetland of up to 160 acres in size. As discussed below, due to the nature of the soil in this wetland, the majority of mercury and sulfate laden seepage will be delivered into the wetland, as opposed to going directly to the drain pipe system. The potential extent of this perimeter wetland is shown in the figure below, which is from Barr 2013F, but has been highlighted in yellow to show the perimeter area between the Tailings Basin and drainage pipe.",WAT,S,N,8,The project does not propose creation of significant
Daniel Pauly,"Wetlands have been known for some time to be prime locations for methylation of mercury from its inorganic form to its far more hazardous organic methylmercury form. Recent research in Minnesota has shown that some of the highest methylmercury levels ever recorded have been observed in restored wetlands. In addition, recent Minnesota DNR research at tailings basins has shown that seepage water from tailings basins has particularly high methylmercury concentrations during seasons of heightened biological activity. As discussed below, the proposed Tailings Basin capture system has the potential to create very high levels of methylmercury. Once created, the methylmercury will be able to exit the capture area either by 1) biological transport into the Embarrass River watershed, or 2) passing through the Waste Water Treatment Plant, which has not been designed or tested to remove it.",MERC,NS,X,1,
Daniel Pauly,"The unique nature of the soils at the NorthMet site result in delivery of tailings seepage to the wetlands, rather than to the drainage pipe. The Containment System called for in the FEIS is shown in cross section below, which is taken from Figure 4 of reference PolyMet 2013f. This figure is a useful one for evaluating containment system flow during mine operations because it is taken on the north end of the Tailings Basin where the greatest amount of discharge is predicted. The black lines show the flow path of the seepage according to NorthMet Project Modeling. Notably, according to the model, 78 percent of the seepage water is delivered to the wetlands, while only 22 percent of it is delivered to the Containment System Drain Pipe. The reason for this flow path, according to FEIS documents, is that the relatively low hydraulic conductivity of the soils forces the water to the surface, where wetlands will likely expand and proliferate. Within these large perimeter wetlands, the ideal conditions for mercury methylation are likely to occur: abundant mercury, sulfate, dissolved organic compounds (DOC), and water. The FEIS entirely fails to consider what will happen when the mercury, sulfates, DOC and water combine in these perimeter wetlands.",WET,S,N,8,"The project does not propose creation of significant wetland acreages at the Plant Site. Methylmercury is created by bacteria in highly organic portions of aquatic systems, such as the sediment of lakes and wetlands. Relative to the wetland area between the tailings basin and the Embarrass River, there would be minimal wetland areas between the toe of the tailings basin and the seepage containment system, which is where such methylation could potentially occur. See FEIS Figure 5.2.3-18."

PolyMet 2015d Section 6.4.3. The proposed project would be required to meet sulfate and mercury effluent limits and not impede the Statewide Mercury TMDL goals that aim to reduce mercury contamination in fish.
Daniel Pauly,"Recent DNR research also shows that taconite tailings basins can have particularly high methylmercury releases that coincide with times of greatest biological activity in wetlands. This research should be considered in evaluating impact of wetlands positioned between the Tailings Basin and containment system drain pipe. Another very serious issue as it relates to methylmercury releases is that recent MNDR research shows that discharges from a taconite tailings basin had a seasonal spike in methylmercury discharges during the summer months when most wetland biological activity occurs. This research is compiled in “Sulfate and Mercury Cycling in Five Wetlands and a Lake Receiving Sulfate from Taconite Mines in Northeastern Minnesota”, Berndt and Bavin, 2011. Reproduced below is a portion of Figure 9 of Berndt and Bavin, showing the seasonal changes in total mercury and methylmercury from May to October. The excerpt above shows how total mercury was essentially constant from May to October, but the amount of methylmercury increased significantly during summer months. It is not clear if more methylmercury is being produced during the summer months, or if it is simply being released in greater quantities, but this increase should be of great concern to anyone proposing a Tailings Basin perimeter wetland. Should this effect also hold true at the NorthMet Tailings Basin, levels of methylmercury must be contemplated, especially during summer months. A further concern raised in Berndt and Bavin with regard to the examined wetland, at a taconite tailings basin toe similar to the NorthMet Tailings Basin, is that the mechanism for the increases in methylmercury are not obvious nor necessarily fully understood. Berndt and Bavin at page 13. It may be that increases in sulfate reduction in summer months lead to accelerated methylmercury production. It appeared that the methylmercury increased across a backdrop of continuous amounts of sulfate reduction and DOC release. In evaluating the containment system as proposed, evaluation of increased methyl mercury loading should be evaluated. Inquiry should be made to assess how much of the methylmercury can be expected to bioaccumulate in organisms in the wetland and how much will go to the WWTP. Based on Figure 4, above, it would appear that most seepage from the toe of the Tailings Basin will be delivered to the wetlands. This is of great concern because summer is the time of greatest biological activity, and the time when greatest bio absorption can be inferred to occur.",MERC,S,N,8,"SDEIS Themes MERC 08, MERC 09, PD 08.

Daniel Pauly,"This methylmercury is likely to be transported out of the containment system wetlands by biological activity. That which remains and is captured, will go to the WWTP where no plans have been made for it to be captured and removed. One potential major impact of the newly proposed containment system is that in addition to creating a large wetland where methylmercury can accumulate and form, the wetland will provide a biological pathway for transport of the methylmercury to the Embarrass River watershed and then into the St. Louis River. Current research (available from the comment author upon request) shows that everything from mosquitos to earthworms can accumulate methyl mercury in high doses. These simple life forms will likely either simply fly out of the containment system (in the case of insects) or be consumed by other mobile organisms (such as great blue herons, egrets, pipers, gulls, ducks, raccoons, etc.) that will allow transport of the mercury up the food chain in the Embarrass River watershed, where it will eventually accumulate in fish and humans. Whereas this avenue of transport totally avoids the drainage pipe collection system and the WWTP, it is a problem for which no solution has been proposed. Note that with 78 percent of mercury being delivered to the wetlands, along with potential methyl mercury spikes that are known to occur at taconite tailings basins, the potential for this bioaccumulation is significant. It is also likely to continue for hundreds, if not thousands of years, and will be far greater than would occur with the lower water flows of the No Action Alternative or the other Tailings Basin alternatives discussed below.",MERC,S,N,8,"The project does not propose creation of significant wetland acreages at the Plant Site.

See FEIS Figure 5.2.3-18."
Daniel Pauly,"The failure to appreciate the potential for groundwater mercury impacts from the NorthMet Tailings Basin resulted in alternatives being improperly dismissed in the DEIS and FEIS that should have been considered. NEPA and MEPA require consideration of alternatives, as summarized below in one of PolyMet’s ERM reports: NEPA and MEPA have slightly different requirements for considering alternatives. NEPA describes the consideration of alternatives as the “heart of the environmental impact statement.” NEPA requires the consideration of all reasonable alternatives and a discussion of alternatives which were eliminated from further study. The decision maker must consider all reasonable alternatives and cannot consider alternatives not discussed in the EIS. MEPA (Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2300, subpart G) states that an alternative may be excluded if “it would not meet the underlying need for or purpose of the Project; it would likely not have any significant environmental benefit compared to the Project as proposed; or another alternative, of any type, that will be analyzed in the DEIS would likely have similar environmental benefits but substantially less adverse economic, employment, or sociological impacts.” (ERM Report, Emphasis added). In the present case, as discussed in related comments, the failure of the DEIS and FEIS process to consider mercury impacts from the NorthMet Project has resulted in potentially superior alternatives being prematurely dismissed.",ALT,S,O,4,SDEIS Theme ALT 13
Daniel Pauly,"The failure of the FEIS to consider non-compliant mercury discharges resulted in improper elimination of alternative tailing basin covers during the ERM process. In December, 2010 the ERM presented recommended alternatives for the NorthMet Mine Tailings Basin Cover Options, including both an evaluation and recommendation. In that 12/2010 report the ERM stated, correctly, that: The Tailings Basin cover system is a very important environmental component of the overall NorthMet Project . . . . At least some seepage is expected to occur long term (e.g. centuries) from the Tailings Basin after closure, so the quality of that seepage is of critical importance and will largely determine the need for long-term operation, maintenance, and/or treatment. (ERM at Page 1, emphasis added) The report then states, incorrectly, that: Based on the analysis of the DEIS, the current PolyMet Proposal (i.e. referred to as the Tailings Basin Alternative in the DEIS) was predicted to generally meet groundwater standards with the primary exception of sulfate. . . . [but] no long-term operation, maintenance, or treatment would be needed for the Tailings Basin as currently modeled for any other parameter because they are predicted to meet groundwater standards. (ERM at page 17). The ERM report subsequently evaluated five different alternatives on the basis of sulfate loads, with no mention or consideration of potential for mercury release from the Tailings Basin. In fact, this key planning document discusses sulfate 50 times on its 22 pages, but not once does the word mercury even appear. This is a prime example of why the NorthMet Project should be reevaluated to consider alternatives that will satisfy the NEPA and MEPA screening requirement for mercury. In this case, the NorthMet Project has identified the criticality of the Tailings Basin cover to groundwater seepage, but FEIS entirely disregards likely mercury impacts, even though mercury release is the single biggest threat of public health from the NorthMet Project.",MERC,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme MERC 20
Daniel Pauly,"Deficiencies in Tailings Basin mercury characterization have resulted in failure to evaluate two viable, and potentially superior, Tailings Basin alternatives. In particular, TBM-3 and TBM-21 should be evaluated as better performing alternatives During the DEIS process, two specific Tailings Basin alternatives were proposed that have the potential to meet all environmental requirements and also be less expensive than the proposed NorthMet alternative. The first of these alternatives, TBM-3, would have included a full liner between new and existing tailings. The second of these alternatives, TBM-21, would have called for an alternative location of a new basin. Both of these mitigation measures were deemed to address all four of the issues identified in the Tailings Basin mitigation process (See DEIS at pages 3-56 to 3-58), but were dismissed as being economically inferior to the recommended proposal. Specifically, it should be noted that each design would meet the purpose and need, would be technically feasible, and would be regulatorily feasible. When TBM-3 and TBM- 21 were dismissed, the economic viability was being compared to the original DEIS proposal, which did not include the containment system or WWTP as proposed, both of which increase the cost of the presently proposed design relative to the prior DEIS proposal. In addition, the now apparent need to also remove mercury from Tailings Basin seepage, as well to prevent it from entering wetlands surrounding the Tailings Basin, will add additional cost to the proposed Tailings Basin plan. The failure to properly conduct a WWTP pilot test adds even greater uncertainty to the potential costs of the proposed Tailings Basin alternative. In aggregate, these changes in the Tailings Basin options since the DEIS eliminated TBM-3 and TBM-21 indicate that the dismissed alternatives should be reconsidered.

Based on what has happened, or is happening, at other Sulfide bearing Hard Rock mines throughout the world, such as the Gilt Edge Mine in South Dakota, Mount Polley in Brittish Columbia, the EPA disaster in Colorado, numerous mines in Montana like those at Butte, and at Lac Du Flambeau in Wisconsin among many others, I know that not only do these mines pollute continuously, and indefinitely. I also know that these mines and the systems put in place to protect the environment from them commonly fail catastrophically. Therefore, I feel very strongly that if our elected and appointed officials in Minnesota and at the Federal level do approve this FEIS and the necessary permits for this or any other Hard Rock copper nickel mine Minnesotan's deserve at the very least strong financial assurance from Poly Met and it's backers that Poly Met is going to foot the bill to clean up the mess, not Minnesotan's or federal tax payers via the Super Fund Site option. History tells us that $500,000,000 five-hundred million dollars is not at all an unreasonable level of financial assurance to demand from Poly Met or any other similar project. The tax payers are sick and tired of the rampant corporate welfare taking place in this state and the country in general.

Brian Hanson,"In my assessment, the correct steps have been taken to move the PolyMet NorthMet Mine to permitting. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Forest Service have determined that PolyMet’s mine can comply with strict state and federal environmental standards, while protecting Minnesota’s land and water. Their work is detailed in the FEIS and concludes more than 10 years of diligent study and review. The project’s economic significance to northern Minnesota brings hope to the region and entire state. APEX is excited that this project is one step closer to creating thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of new family-sustaining mining jobs in our region. Let’s get on with it! I am confident in the strength of the project environmental review process. The FEIS is a culmination of the dedicated efforts of many agencies, with significant public input. Thousands of comments and questions submitted during the review periods for the draft and supplemental draft environmental impact statements have been addressed and incorporated in the FEIS. The agencies considered the project’s potential effects on air and water quality with respect to human health and identified no adverse health risks. Water modeling shows that PolyMet’s treatment and mitigation plans will meet all water quality standards and prevent damage to waterways. The FEIS also concludes that any possible groundwater flow will be prevented. The level of detail included in the FEIS is astounding. It is clear the document meets all state and national environmental requirements. The state of Minnesota can model responsible mining practices and innovative environmental protection technologies for the rest of the nation and the world. Our country needs these strategic metals. Northeast Minnesota has the innovative know-how, the workforce, the infrastructure, the environmental ethic and the community support to ensure this project will serve our state in a legal and ethical manner. It is imperative that we move forward with all haste to rebuild our mining economy and stem job losses on Minnesota’s Iron Range. All mining activities bring both risks and rewards. PolyMet will bring significant rewards to the entire state, and the FEIS proves that the risks of copper-nickel mining have been mitigated. Simply put, the rewards far outweigh the risks.

Anthony Runkel,"The content of the FEIS dealing with bedrock hydrogeology is improved over the SDEIS in a number of ways. The inclusion of a higher hydraulic conductivity layer corresponding to shallow bedrock conditions, and adjustments to conductivity parameters in the models, are positive additions. The FEIS also more clearly and consistently acknowledges the potential for enhanced flow along fractures that have yet to be identified at the mine and plant sites. Another improvement is the addition of possible mitigation strategies should such enhanced flow be recognized during mining, or post-mining operations. Other approaches suggested in my (and other) 2014 SDEIS comments to improve the NorthMet site characterization were not employed. These include the use of routine techniques such as depth discrete head measurements, water chemistry (for residence time), borehole geophysical logs, and packer tests; all targeted towards identification of enhanced flow through fractures. The FEIS justifies the exclusion of these and related techniques mostly by suggesting that the current level hydrogeologic characterization for the NorthMet site is adequate, and that it is based on techniques and assumptions that are “standard approaches” or “common practice” in the mining industry. While it is not the role of a non-regulatory agency such as the Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS) to determine what is “adequate” in a permitting process, the MGS does have a responsibility to inform the process as an unbiased source of Earth Science information when we have the expertise to do so. In that spirit, the remainder of this FEIS comment provides what I consider to be a scientifically current perspective on “standard approaches” in the field of hydrogeology that would improve the ability to predict impacts of the proposed mining at the NorthMet site. If the approach used to characterize the hydrogeologic conditions at the NorthMet site is indeed consistent with standard practice, it might be beneficial to reconsider the standard, or if that standard is appropriate for a project of this magnitude. A standard that might be sufficient for basic water budget (quantity) predictions may not be a sufficient standard for an activity such as nonferrous metal mining, where transport of contaminants (water quality) is of equal importance to water quantity. The latter should require a more comprehensive hydrogeologic understanding of a site. The techniques described in the Runkel 2014 SDEIS comment, such as depth discrete head measurements, borehole geophysical logging, packer tests, and discrete interval water sampling for residence time information, have been used to improve our understanding of hydrogeologic conditions in this region for nearly two decades. Government agencies that have used these approaches include the Minnesota Department of Health, Pollution Control Agency, Department of Natural Resources, and the Minnesota and Wisconsin Geological Surveys. Industry groundwater consultants have also used many of these approaches for remediation of contamination sites. As a specific example, the DNR Division of Ecological and Water Resources routinely uses information from these techniques to depict hydrogeologic conditions at county-scale, as part of the County Geologic Atlas program. The widespread and longtime use of these approaches to hydrogeologic characterization could therefore be considered common practice. A more systematic approach to identifying enhanced flow along fractures that included routine techniques such as those described here would have reduced uncertainties inherent in the predictions of water-related impacts at the NorthMet site. For example, identification of enhanced flow along fractures would lead to significantly shorter predicted travel times than currently estimated in the FEIS. The unrecognized presence of especially high conductivity fractures can also lead to miscalculation of flux predictions. Current predictions of flux described in the FEIS are based on a conceptual model in which the bedrock fracture network is deemed to be sufficiently well-connected at site- scale to behave as equivalent porous media, and that a low bulk hydraulic conductivity is representative of the entire site. The bulk hydraulic conductivity, and thus the flux, will be greater than currently estimated if high conductivity fractures are present, but remain unidentified. The limited number of boreholes and manner in which those holes were tested at the site greatly reduced the odds of identifying any such fractures. In summary, the FEIS is improved over the SDEIS, but a considerably more complete understanding of the hydrogeologic conditions could have been achieved by including information derived from a number of well-established, common practice techniques that provide greater insight into transport through fractured bedrock. These improvements would decrease the odds of unanticipated environmental impacts, and, if the proposed project moves forward in the permitting process, lead to more robust water protection and monitoring strategies.",WAT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WR 007, WR 012"

Martin Cooney,"Properly structured, the financial assurance requirement will force PolyMet to pay the full cost of mining in Minnesota. This requirement is by definition onerous to the mining venture. Setting aside millions of dollars requires significant additional investment on the part of PolyMet’s parent company. This will depress rates of return, just like any other cost of doing business. To keep faith with Minnesota taxpayers the DNR must resist pressure by PolyMet and mining advocates on the Range and their lobbyists or elected political representatives to compromise on the rigor and objectivity required to protect the environment. If the mining companies cannot make money by bearing all of the costs arising from their mining operation, they should not be mining in Minnesota. Period. Fortunately, the Minnesota legislature can profit from other states’ bitter experience with regulating non-ferrous mining activities. In 2008, Minnesota passed a financial assurance law specifically requiring non-ferrous mining companies such as PolyMet to provide a bankruptcy-proof pool of high quality guarantees and/or financial instruments under the control of the commissioner of Minnesota’s Department of Natural Resources (“DNR”) to ensure that all requirements of non-ferrous mining permits, including the cost of reclaiming the mine and any environmental damage arising from the mining activities are paid for by the mining concern and not the Minnesota taxpayer.

Martin Cooney,"1. Formally Incorporate the Financial Assurance Detail into the EIS Process In its online Financial Assurance Fact Sheet1, PolyMet states that “It is not typical for financial assurance to be included in an EIS as it is in the PolyMet environmental review.” If this is the case, this is a deficiency in Minnesota’s EIS process. The DNR should make financial assurance a mandatory component of all future draft and final EISs. Doing so will ensure that the “purpose and requirement of financial assurance, including the rules and criteria that would be used in determining financial assurance and the risk analysis involved, as well as how [an applicant] would calculate financial assurance during the permitting process”2would be clearly specified for the benefit of the applicant and rigorous public review. The number of public comments complaining of the lack of detail in connection with all aspects of the financial assurance requirement, as described in the draft environmental impact statement (“DEIS”) is evidence of the need for this modification in the EIS process. The FEIS refers all comments on the DEIS’s financial assurance section to Section 3.2.2.4 in the FEIS. This section consists of “available detail” related to financial assurance, which does not begin to provide sufficient detail on the specifics of the financial assurance to permit informed comment. As it stands right now, financial assurance remains a “black box” to the Minnesota public. The FEIS states that “additional details on the cost estimates and calculations that would be required for the project would be addressed during permitting”. These additional details are critical. Given the importance of the financial assurance to safeguard the taxpayer, the DNR must assure the public that the permitting process will be transparent enough to allow for thoughtful public comment on PolyMet’s financial assurance requirements prior to the finalization of the permit, if the DNR is disposed to grant the permit. Financial assurance is the taxpayer’s most important insurance policy against natural disaster, incompetence, malfeasance, negligence, and plain bad luck in connection with this mining venture.",PER,S,O,11,SDEIS Theme FIN 13
Martin Cooney,"2. Make the Financial Assurance Detail for the PolyMet Permit Available for Public Review and Comment Prior to Completion of the Permitting Process PolyMet is the first of many sulfide mining permit applications pending for consideration by the DNR. The DNR should establish a public review of each project’s financial assurance details as standard operating procedure for every permit. The PolyMet application, as first in line, is setting precedent for future non-ferrous mining applications. Both the DNR and PolyMet are assuring the public that the detail will be addressed in the permitting process that follows completion of the FEIS. To satisfy the public interest in this crucial piece of the mining permit application, details of the plans for PolyMet’s and all other non-ferrous mining venture’s financial assurance should be available for public review and comment prior to the finalization of each Permit to Mine. The publicly available detail should include: ? detailed scope of costs covered; ? the methodology and assumptions employed in the financial calculations; ? the minimum standard for publicly available credit ratings of any bank, insurance company, surety, financial instrument, or other component of the financial assurance fund; ? provisions for the termination, (if any) and/or replacement of the component instruments or sureties of the financial assurance; ? detail on the timing and amounts of contributions to and withdrawals from the financial assurance fund; and, ? ongoing participation of qualified financial advisors on matters of increases or reductions of the amount of financial assurance stemming from the annual review. Given the risk of extensive environmental damage to the State and the track record of financial irresponsibility of similar sulfide mining ventures in the past elsewhere, the public is putting more stock in the availability of bulletproof financial assurance to clean up a potential environmental mess than in PolyMet’s ability to police itself, or the DNR’s ability to effectively oversee this project given the project’s scope and the DNR’s lack of institutional experience in regulating and monitoring sulfide mining operations.",PER,S,O,11,SDEIS Theme FIN 13
Martin Cooney,"3. The Financial Assurance Amount Must Include Provisions for Unanticipated Corrective Actions The purpose of financial assurance is to eliminate the risk that the Minnesota taxpayer will ever be required to pay the bill for environmental damage caused by the PolyMet mining operation, a for-profit venture. The residents of the Iron Range certainly do not want to be held solely responsible for the cost of cleaning up an environmental mess even though they would benefit directly from PolyMet’s activities. Neither should the Minnesota taxpayer at large have to pay for cleaning up a mess stemming from activities that benefitted the Iron Range directly. These financial assurance rules are the only insurance that the Minnesota taxpayer has that these costs will be borne by the mining venture and not the taxpayer. The Minnesota Administrative Rules related to financial assurance3 require the Applicant (PolyMet) to annually adjust its financial assurance amount, reflecting all the risks entailed in the mining operation at that point, and to report these estimates to the DNR in its Annual Report. These reported cost estimates include: ? The Contingency Reclamation Cost Estimate, which is intended to cover the cost of closure and post closure activities associated with an orderly wind-up of the mining operation within one year, including the ongoing expenses of limiting environmental damage from the residue of twenty-years of sulfide mining for an indeterminate period – estimated to be as short as 200 years, or as long as forever; and, ? The Corrective Action Cost Estimates, which include the estimated cost of implementing corrective actions of known deficiencies in compliance with the permit. The Corrective Action Cost Estimates, should include not only the cost of implementing corrective actions of known deficiencies, but also make provisions for the costs of correcting and mitigating the environmental damage associated with the plausible failure scenarios that the DNR must certainly have considered in the formulation and evaluation of the EIS and other facets of the permit application. Diligent monitoring of the mining operation would be expected to include the identification of, and costing out of, potential accidents or material failures of the processes and structures that are put in place to mitigate environmental damage. While it is not possible to know with certainty what the cost of one or more potential serious system failures may be, it should be possible to develop a probabilistic estimate of the correct addition to the financial assurance Corrective Action Cost Estimates that will consider the frequency and magnitude of plausible failure scenarios identified by the DNR. The purpose for securing financial assurance in advance of planned or potential expenditures is to ensure that the projector’s funds4 are available to protect the State’s taxpayers at all times, even in the face of a PolyMet bankruptcy. If the financial assurance amount only includes funds in an amount equal to expected costs, unexpected or unplanned contingencies would likely exhaust the financial assurance fund and expose the taxpayer, thus frustrating the legislature’s intent. To be effective, the financial assurance amount must cover estimated costs of planned corrective activities; an orderly wind-up of the mining operation; and, the cost of correcting and cleaning up the environmental damage caused by one or more plausible, but unanticipated, failures at the mining site. The financial assurance amount must also assume that PolyMet will be unable, and the parent company (Glencore plc) will be unwilling or unable, to make up any deficiencies in the financial assurance fund. Were this to happen, ant shortfalls would have to be covered by the taxpayer, which is precisely what the legislature and the DNR rulemaking process intended to avoid by requiring financial assurance. Anything less than a financial assurance amount included for unanticipated contingencies will be insufficient.",PER,S,N,11,"As part of the Permit to Mine, the Final SDD"
Martin Cooney,"The Financial Assurance Amount Must be Reviewed By Completely Independent Financial and Engineering Experts The Minnesota Administrative Rules 5 provide that the permittee, PolyMet in this case, shall submit an estimate of the components of the financial assurance amount to the DNR commissioner as part of an annual report on the project. Estimating the sufficiency of the financial assurance amount, including funds for unplanned contingencies involves two fundamentally different activities. After the commissioner establishes the objectives required to comply with the Permit to Mine, the first process is to assess the necessary material handling, construction, and mining costs required to achieve these goals. This assessment will ultimately drive the amount and timing of the expenditures. The second process entails determining the timing and amount of the delivery of the financial assurance funds. This must be conducted by finance professionals, expert in the application of financial mathematics to problems of this nature. They should be retained and supervised by the commissioner and selected on the basis of fitness for the task. These experts should be free of any connection with the mining industry, PolyMet, or its affiliates, or any other relationship that could suggest a conflict of interest. The DNR must make every effort to ensure that their choice of experts cannot be criticized for a real or imagined conflict of interest, as occurred with the selection of Crowell and Moring by the Governor’s Office to defend the State against potential lawsuits pending the decision on PolyMet’s permit application as reported by the Star Tribune in early December, 2015.",PER,S,N,11,"As part of the Permit to Mine, the Final SDD indicated that financial assurance estimates will be developed on an annual basis for reclamation of mining activities that have occurred and are anticipated to occur during the upcoming year.

Martin Cooney,"Disclosure of the Details of the Financial Assurance Fund Requirement For Public Comment Must Clearly Explain the Gap Between PolyMet’s Estimated $200 million Maximum and Estimates Produced by the Public Prior To a Final Decision on the Issuance of the Permit The lack of clarity in connection with the size of the financial assurance fund has generated a wide range of estimates. Not surprisingly, that of PolyMet is lower by half than many of those produced independently by advocates opposed to permitting the project. PolyMet estimates in Table 3.2-15 Preliminary Cost Estimate for Closure of the FEIS that the fund requirement for financial assurance to cover closure and reclamation will peak within a range of somewhere between $160 and $200 million in Year 11. This requirement is exclusive of the cost of treating the water for anywhere between 200 years and perpetuity (?!). PolyMet estimates the annual cost of this last requirement to be between $3.5 and $6 million per year. If these annual recurring costs are capitalized and added to the PolyMet estimate for closure and reclamation, the total estimated financial assurance amount still falls significantly short of the amount posited in an analysis prepared by Messrs. Sternal, Thometz, and Gappa employing PolyMet’s publicly disclosed information6. In their analysis, these finance professionals conservatively estimated the minimum financial assurance funding requirement at $350 million. The DNR must find a way to publicly describe the essentials of its estimation methodology and publish a draft computation for a preliminary financial assurance requirement. This would include addressing obvious questions, for example: ? the length of time, post closing the mining facility, that the DNR assumes that polluted water must be filtered and monitored before it can be released; ? the methodology it employs to estimate the amount required for unplanned contingent costs; ? the discount rate and earnings credit applied to securities included in the fund; and, ? the assumptions related to the cost of financial assurance provided by third parties (banks and sureties) as these must come out of the fund earnings. Finally, if the DNR’s estimate of the required fund amount submitted for public comment diverges materially from the many plausible good faith estimates of the required fund amount by various environmental organizations and concerned citizens, it should be prepared to provide a generally accessible reconciliation between its preliminary calculation and these higher independent estimates. The release of this information must be done in such a way as to protect PolyMet’s essential confidential financial and engineering information. However, the principal objective is to allay the public’s suspicions and the criticisms that inevitably arise from a lack of transparency. A project of this import, touching upon jobs and the environment, must be absolutely above-board and free from the taint of double-dealing. Despite opposition on principle to sulfide mining in Minnesota, or specific perceived deficiencies of the project, opponents may feel that their concerns are mitigated if the DNR demonstrates unambiguously that the financial assurance amount is very conservatively estimated and that it is sufficient to meet the costs of any plausible unforeseen environmental catastrophe caused by PolyMet. This is a complex area that lends itself to easy obfuscation. The DNR should be mindful of this risk and exert itself to deliver this information clearly and transparently, including taking comments prior to the finalization of the financial assurance amount.",PER,S,N,11,"As part of the Permit to Mine, the Final SDD indicated that financial assurance estimates will be developed on an annual basis for reclamation of mining activities that have occurred and are anticipated to occur during the upcoming year.

Although mineland reclamation rules allow for financial assurance for corrective action, the amount of financial assurance cannot be developed until the needed corrective action is known. For this reason financial assurance estimates associated with corrective action will not be included in the EIS. However, the EIS will describe the corrective action procedure and how financial assurance will be addressed in case a corrective action is needed."
Martin Cooney,"6. The Financial Assurance Fund Must be Structured to Ensure Seamless Protection For Minnesota Taxpayers There are various risks associated with accepting anything but US government securities to fill the financial assurance fund. Alternatives to securities included in the financial assurance administrative rule are: A letter of credit (“LOC”), which is a promise by a commercial bank to pay the beneficiary (the State of Minnesota) if a clearly defined event occurs, such as PolyMet’s failure to meet the terms of the permit. Banks, like corporate bonds, also subject the beneficiary to credit risk and, if they become insolvent, cannot meet their obligation to pay the State. A surety bond, which is very similar to a bank LOC, and bears many of the same risks, including the surety’s inability to pay due to insolvency. In addition, conditions under which the State may call on a surety often present more execution risk than does drawing on a bank LOC; Basic types of financial risk inherent in a long-term financial assurance requirement: Credit risk: the credit quality of mortgage-backed, corporate, municipal, and state securities may fluctuate. Deteriorating credit quality adversely affects the market value (realizable price of the security if it must be liquidated by the commissioner) of the security because of increased risk of default; Interest Rate Risk: The market value of a fixed rate security, even a “risk-free” security like US Treasury bonds, can drop if market interest rates rise above the level they were at when the security was purchased. While not affecting the ultimate principal amount deliverable at maturity, interest rate risk does affect the value of the security if it must be liquidated prior to maturity. The longer the period to maturity, the greater the volatility in the security’s value. Recent statements by the Federal Reserve suggest that interest rates are due for a gradual secular rise, meaning that it more likely than not that the value of fixed rate securities will be adversely affected over the foreseeable future. ? Rollover (replacement) risk: There is no rollover risk in a security as it converts to cash upon maturity. The security matures, but the cash paid at maturity remains in the fund until the moneys are reinvested. Protection continues. However, once a bank LOC or surety agreement expires, there is no funding event. The protection offered by these institutions simply ceases to exist. Without adequate safeguards, the State is vulnerable to PolyMet finding a replacement guarantor or failing to come up with the cash itself. Such replacement is occasionally unavailable, leaving the beneficiary exposed. The purpose of financial assurance is to avoid this risk altogether. Due to regulatory restrictions, bank LOCs and surety bonds are never issued in perpetuity. Bank LOCs are seldom issued for terms in excess of five years. PolyMet will tend to propose these instruments to the State because paying a fee to the bank or surety for a guarantee is significantly less expensive to than locking up funds in a low-risk/low-yield security, such as US Treasury bonds, for twenty years or more. The DNR must be mindful of the credit and rollover risk associated with third party guarantors. There are structuring options that permit a draw on the guarantees/LOCs if a replacement cannot be secured within a given period prior to expiration, or a the credit rating trigger that permits a draw on the guarantee if the guarantor’s credit rating declines below a specified level. However, these arrangements must be entered into with the advice of financial professionals, with expertise not only the financial engineering, but drawing up legal documentation to ensure the objectives of the financial assurance are met. Guarantors will want to maximize their flexibility and PolyMet will want to minimize its cost. Both objectives work to the detriment of the taxpayers and their agent, the DNR. Retaining experienced independent advisors will compensate for the DNR’s lack of experience in these matters.",PER,S,N,11,
Martin Cooney,"As stated at the outset, I am utterly opposed to the PolyMet application, and all pending sulfide mining applications, on the grounds that the ephemeral benefits of these projects to all the residents of Minnesota, including those of the Iron Range and all other citizens of the United States as a whole, do not begin to outweigh the potential cost of an environmental debacle of tragic proportions. Such a tragedy could easily pollute our drinking water, lakes, rivers, streams, and aquifers for generations to come. At a time when drinking water is being poisoned by fracking and phosphate runoff from industrial agriculture, forests in western states are burning up square miles at a time and cities on the Pacific Coast are rationing water consumption, we are seriously considering risking polluting our principal natural resource in perpetuity. And all for a limited economic benefit that will come calling again in twenty years to further erode our precious water. There can be no justification for this intentional despoilment. We have a one hundred and thirty year history of relatively successful iron ore mining in Minnesota. In over a century, we have learned, by and large, how to regulate this mining process. Sulfide mining is a completely different proposition. Can we believe that we can regulate these mining companies effectively, when we do not have the institutional memory or resources in our regulatory bodies to stay ahead of the mining companies’ natural propensity to embrace expediency? There is no contest. If the provisions for financial assurance fail to impose the full cost of the externalities of the PolyMet mining venture on the prime beneficiary of this project, PolyMet’s shareholders, this Permit to Mine should never be issued. We will never have more negotiating power over PolyMet, and by implication, all other sulfide mining ventures waiting in the wings, to protect the environment and ensure that sulfide mining is conducted responsibly than we do at this very moment. If this project must move ahead, the DNR must make up for its lack of experience in sulfide mining by hiring the best independent advisors available and structure a model financial assurance design, implementation and management process. In addition, financial assurance must become an integral part of the EIS process. Specific to PolyMet, the public must be made aware of the details of the determination of the financial assurance amount and how its integrity will be maintained over the life of the project, after the spotlight has moved on. The public must also be allowed to comment on the detail prior to the issuance of the permit.

None of the specific comments have produced improvements to fill critically important gaps in the data presented.

These data gaps were produced by 1) not setting the detection limits for analysis of samples sensitive enough to measure the analytes of interest for hazard and environmental impact assessments; 2) not requiring representative numbers of solid samples to be analyzed to adequately characterize the solids proposed to be mined, or including NBS certified solid samples to document the accuracy of analyte measurements; 3) selecting methodology and procedures for laboratory studies that produced results not consistent with the true characteristics and nature of actual conditions (omitting freeze-thaw and temperature cycles/ variations, and bacterial actions) that will occur when mining is conducted and bedrock exposed to the Northern Minnesota environment; and 4) not presenting the knowledge base of relevant information where acid mine drainage has sterilized thousands of miles of streams in Pennsylvania, for which no remedy for successful remediation and recovery has yet been found.",WAT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes MERC 04, WR 008, WR 014, WR 023, WR 025"

Mercury data for solids to be mined is very sparse and inadequate in the FEIS. The mercury content data for chemical reagents, especially sulfuric acid, proposed to be used in processing the ore and ore extracts are absent altogether. These and other data gaps when filled will give a more complete picture necessary for assessing and reducing the proposed project's impacts, including the fish-mercury hazard present in the adjacent and downstream waters.",MERC,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme MERC 04
Gary Glass,"Many of the mine/ore processing issues are understated with the gaps in data where hazardous components have seemingly been purposely omitted from data tables to minimize the consideration of the future hazards that are to be expected from the handling of millions of tons of reactive sulfide ores and reactive sulfide waste rock containing many elements/substances known to be toxic to humans and wildlife. The underlying, unarticulated strategy seems to be that omission, and/or minimization by comparison with larger regional or global quantities, i.e., mercury emissions, should be instead substituted for scientifically, valid component characterization data which accurately and completely characterizes the solids to be mined. To illustrate this point, and contrary to what is presently in the FEIS, significant quantities of the element mercury are present in the solids to be mined, and is measured in 20 of 92 rock samples (22%) at the 1 part per million concentration level (Comment #8 SDEIS, SRK2007b). The element uranium is also present at significant quantities, and is measured in five of 92 rock samples (5.4%) at the 10 parts per million concentration level (SRK2007b). These samples may or may not be indicative of the highest concentrations in the ore body to be mined. Many more samples (more than 18,800) were analyzed for sulfide to accurately characterize the solid volumes to be mined and processed. Parts per million concentration levels means for every million tons containing the measured toxic component there is one ton of toxic component present, and should be accounted for in the FEIS. The FEIS makes the assumption that some toxic components will be of little or no concern, and if they were to show up in future monitoring, they would be properly dealt with. The fatal flaw in this approach is that by not properly characterizing the ore body, there will be no justification for a monitoring program to detect these hazardous component hot spots and no action will be triggered to properly isolate and treat the resultant hazardous emissions. The citizens of Minnesota will end up paying the price for improperly or untreated hazards by experiencing worker illnesses or in the cases of the 62 AOCs at the LTVMC site or the 1300 barrels of toxic compounds hidden on the RMC mining site, having to deal with hazardous, polluted land areas and/or paying taxpayers money for remediation (see my comment #9 DEIS).

Gary Glass,"The land exchange (also see Comment #2 SDEIS) requested is larger in area than needed for the project to be conducted, and is apparently to be used to push out the property boundaries to greater distances so that the hazards of pollution expected to be generated by the proposed project are more diluted before crossing the property lines and will take more time to travel before being detected, and trigger some sort of alarm that harm is on its way off the project property. This apparent strategy is inconsistent with Minnesota Rules for dealing with reactive mine ores and reactive wastes to make them non-reactive, and prevent water from flowing through or over wastes, and collect and treat that which does to meet state and federal standards. Property line boundaries should not be used as test points for pollution on the move, but rather, the proposed project's source points/areas releasing the hazardous substances should be where the test points are to be located and monitored/measured. More accurate measurements may be made BEFORE any dilution takes place due to instrument calibration and sensitivity requirements.

Gary Glass,"Additional Alternatives should be proposed to accelerate, not retard, the chemical reactions of the reactive sulfide ore components with oxygen, water, and heat, and thus neutralize the reactive sulfide components. The present approach is to delay the reactions and store the reactive hazardous producing material in containment structures that can leak, and push treatment of toxic reaction products into long-lasting future care, requiring constant monitoring at greater expense, and creating a threat of probable damage to future aquatic resources. By speeding up the reactions of sulfide to creating sulfate, the acid can be neutralized and the resultant waste products, such a gypsum, might be recoverable and converted into a useful products, assuming the acidic and toxic components are removed. The amounts of sulfide to be mined are fairly well determined and no less than 1.5 pounds of sulfate will be produced for every pound of copper extracted, as a minimum. And more likely, up to ten pounds of sulfate will be produced for every pound of copper extracted, if solids are left mainly to convert to sulfuric acid over the long term. This will result in a Additional Alternatives to the permanent storage of all reactive sulfide-containing ores and related solid materials should be given to being stored in containment structures that do not leak water under any circumstances. The proposed mine pits are not leak-proof structures and are expected to allow some flow of groundwater, at will, regardless of the wishes of the owners. Existing pit lakes show direct water flow connections to ground water aquifers out to several thousand feet. The thousands of blasts of explosives used to pulverize the ore body will surely cause structural damage to the adjoining, adjacent rock structures making up the mine pit walls. Then add air and water exposure, and freeze-thaw cycles for the number of years planned before being filled with waste rock, soil, and finally water. In addition, the numbers of drill holes used to sample the ore body will surely also facilitate the movement of groundwater through the mine pit walls and adjacent areas allowing the flow of ground water to be in contact with the reactive sulfide in the pit walls, and waste rock; all to be flushed out by gw flows into the adjoining watersheds, i.e., the Partridge and Embarrass Rivers.

If the need for the metal copper is the primarily driving force behind the proposed project, and if this need could be fulfilled by an alternate approach, then the project as proposed should be revised to process more available sources of copper. The value of copper used in the underground mining assessment is $3.56 per pound, and that the underground mining cost for its recovery would exceed that value. The market price for gathering used copper is today ranges from $1.56. to $1.65 per pound(Azcon Metals, Bayshore Recycling Corp., both Duluth Mn).

The best way to satisfy the stated need is to pursue different objectives, those focused on improving the gathering and re- cycling all copper containing products, and leave the forests and wetlands to support their present productivity - lumber and firewood production, hunting, fishing, wild rice gathering, and recreational activities on the 7,600 acres to continue to be productive forever.",ALT,S,O,4,SDEIS Theme ALT 16.

All Canadian mine operations Dr. Blowes studied and summarized have exhibited contaminated the groundwater at each of the sites, to greater or lesser extents, from the oxidation of sulfide-containing minerals, rock-wastes, and mine tailings, and the subsequent leaching of metals and sulfuric acids into groundwater. If any sulfide minerals are present, they are oxidized and leach toxic acid and metals in toxic concentrations. Prof. Blowes presented detailed data and information, and his conclusions were: 1) Immediate oxidation of sulfides by gaseous air is the major mechanism causing toxic components to be leachable. The first five-to-ten years or mineral exposure to air are the most important to control and prevent oxidation and leaching; 2) Groundwater is the major recipient and conduit for toxic leachate from waste sulfide-containing piles to surface waters down stream. Water travel-times of 2-200 meters per day are typical for contaminated groundwater streams containing toxic acids and metals; 3) Permanent maintenance funds should be required for all sulfide mineral mine, rock pile, and tailings deposits before mining is allowed to begin.

On a daily rate basis, the tonnages are 32,000 and 91,200 tons per day, respectively.

Comparing the annual ore tonnage to the copper yield gives a beginning ore percentage of copper, 0.33%, and nickel, 0.077%. Assuming CuS and NiS as the predominant chemical forms for each, the mass of sulfide in the ore calculates to about 24,000 tons annually, with a potential to form about 72,000 tons of sulfuric acid. It is not at all clear where and to what fate the sulfide annually processed mass will be become or whether of not it will be neutralized. Assuming the extraction process to be 99% effective this would leave residual copper and nickel concentrations of 33 and 7.7 ppm, respectively, in the extracted sludge. If the waste rock and lean ore were one-tenth the concentrations of the metal sulfide ore being processed, then the potential for sulfuric acid formation by air oxidation in the piles 1-4 would be potentially 24,000 tons x 0.1 x 1.7 = 4,080 tons sulfide, and the potential for 12,000 tons sulfuric acid, added annually, (but not necessarily formed or released annually, since reaction times can take several years). Since there would be no metal extraction, the copper and nickel concentrations if 10 % of the processed ore would be, 330 and 77 ppm, respectively, in the waste rock and lean ore. Clearly these concentrations of metals in conjunction with oxygen reactive sulfide-containing lean ore would be of great concern from the potential for environmental damage to the aquatic environment from the piles containing 394 million tons of waste rock and lean ore.

Just when you think you can develop a modern, safe, environmentally pleasing copper-nickel/precious metals mine the whole thing falls apart and sends a flood of toxic waste downstream. We sure can convince ourselves that we’re smart enough to mine copper-nickel disaster free. We so smart. In the upper watershed of the Fraser River in British Columbia, which happens to be the largest sockeye salmon fishery in Canada, a batch of lead and cadmium and other heavy metals was let loose after an unexpected August 2014 rain event swelled the waste basin to the brim. The earthen dam was simply overwhelmed and that fishery will now have to deal with the stigma that the fish may be contaminated now and into the future. Oh, the supporters of copper-nickel mining in Minnesota finally acknowledged the disaster in very trim words and said they wouldn’t allow that to happen here in this state. Not here. Even though the same waste containment regimes have been proposed. We’re smarter than that here. Our regulations are tough. Real tough. We won’t let that happen in Minnesota, they say. Project supporters said the same thing in Canada, according to scientists assessing the damage for EnvironmentCanada, that nation’s EPA. The waste basin was engineered to withstand the harsh northern British Columbia weather but a rain event like those rain events we’re seeing more and more often these days doomed their predictions of a safe, clean mine in a place where people value the environment more than, say, the Chinese. Mining supporters are always picking on the Chinese or some other less developed nation with the red herring argument that we should mine in Minnesota where the environment will be protected, not devastated, when everybody knows that those global mining giants will mine wherever there’s money to be made and a willing ore body is available. In other words, they aren’t going to suspend mining operations across the developing world just because they’ve decided to zero in on the Duluth Complex in northeastern Minnesota.

This smart thinking has happened forever, of course, especially since the industrial revolution kicked in. We so smart, we can handle the byproducts of a very smart society. First, we dump it into a hole in the ground or into the rivers, lakes and oceans. When that hole fills up or the river catches fire or the fish die and people start getting sick move to Plan B. Smart societies always have Plan B. In the meantime, Superfund sites are all over the countryside. There may be a Superfund site near you. Of course there is. A majority of Americans now live within 20 miles of a nationally recognized Superfund site. We so smart. We so smart, nuclear energy was developed based on the fact that we so smart, of course we’ll figure out a way to deal with plutonium and its million-year half life. In the meantime, entomb those spent fuel rods in concrete and whatever you do don’t take one of those fuel rods out of the water even for a minute. Be smart. Don’t so that. We so smart, here we are 60-70 years later and still without a clue of what to do about radioactive waste. We so smart.

However, it has been clear for some time that the validity of scientific methodology utilized by the applicant for the proposed PolyMet Mine, has been legitimately called into question by the Cooperating Agencies (Grand Portage and Fond du Lac Bands as well as GLIFWC) throughout the various stages of the Environmental Impact Statements for the NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange. Conversely, the Cooperating Agencies scientists have presented Ground Water Hydrology Modeling that utilized historically accurate site data that more accurately reflected current conditions, with more of a likelihood of accurately predicting future conditions. Unfortunately, those findings were not adequately considered by the Co-lead Agencies (US Army Corp of Engineers, Minnesota DNR and US Forest Service).",WAT,NS,X,1,
London Bresette,"Throughout this process the Cooperating Agencies have warned that the flawed scientific methodologies utilized by the applicant would lead to faulty conclusions as to the actual environmental impacts that the proposed mine would cause if ever allowed to operate. However; definitive findings were uncovered by GLIFWC scientists and the Cooperating Agencies experts, communicated no later than July of2015 and were summarized in a letter to the Co-lead Agencies on August 11 1 h, 2015; (This GLIFWC Letter with its Documents was addressed to Michael Jimenez Minerals NEPA Project Manager, Doug Bruner USACE Project Manager and to Lisa Fay EIS Project Manager). Despite this high profile notification, the Co-lead Agencies failed to properly factor and address how the PolyMet Engineers utilized flawed scientific methodology and cherry picked data, which then supports an invalid conclusion that at mine closing; contaminants from the NorthMet Mining Project would exclusively discharge in a south and southeast flow path (south/easterly). Whereas the findings from GLIFWC and the Cooperating Agencies experts clearly demonstrate that both a south/easterly and northerly flow of contaminants would occur at mine closing. Even though it seems as the Co-lead Agencies concede the fact of a "" ... northward flow of pit water from the proposed NorthMet pits to the Northshore pits"" on 5-240 of the FEIS; on page 11 of Fond du Lac Band's Predecision Referral to the CEQ they point out the Co-lead Agencies contradictory conclusion, ""based on their view of the flow paths that result from the applicant's incorrect identification of post-closure adjacent pit water levels, disagree with the Fond du Lac Band, and take the position that the relevant cumulative effects have been evaluated."" This exchange is actually hard to discern because there is absolutely no mention in FEIS Chapter 8 Major Differences of Opinion of the competing conclusions of an exclusive southerly flow path at mine closing or that both a primarily northern and south/easterly flow path would occur. The Co-lead Agencies seem to lean on the exclusive southerly flow as they state on 5-7 of the FEIS: ""It is estimated that more than 98 percent of affected groundwater seepage from the Category 1 stockpile would be captured by the containment system or would migrate as groundwater into the West Pit and East Pit (PolyMet 2015h) ... Following closure, once the West Pit is fully flooded, the treated water would be discharged, as necessary, to the West Pit Outlet Creek that flows into the Partridge River ... After project operations, the only appreciable non-treated mine water leaving the Mine Site would be about 10 gpm of groundwater seepage in the surficial aquifer that would migrate south and eventually be released to the Partridge River."" Instead of directly addressing the environmental impacts, flushed out of the scientifically sound conclusion that flow paths at mine close also travel northward; they chose to simply ignore the grave implications of these findings. On one hand they totally refute its conclusion and yet on the other hand concede to its finding. This concession is convenient for their reconciliation of these findings, in order to justify their inadequate response of dealing with any of these concerns through future monitoring and mitigation efforts. This is seen as totally unacceptable and completely objectionable in how these definitive scientific findings were manipulated. Despite PolyMet engineers selecting an unusually high water elevation year and coupling that with improperly selected Hydrology Data that was gathered from an entirely different decade and scale of operation; the Co-lead Agencies still accepted their flawed scientific methodology. Although this was not the only flawed data PolyMet engineers calculated into this; their epically faulty conclusion that at the end of the mining operation there would only be contaminants flowing south/easterly is irrefutably proven false by GLIFWC and other scientists. The Cooperating Agencies experts utilized Ground Water Modeling and valid criterion with proper principles of scientific methodology, which supports their most recent findings.",WAT,S,N,2,"MDNR et al. 2015c. There is no definitive means to address the issue raised in the comment because the EIS was not scoped to address how future activity at the Peter Mitchell Pit might influence the closure conditions at the NorthMet site. The modeling satisfies Final SDD Section 6.2, which required the groundwater flow model to predict inflows at various stages of pit development (i.e., year 1, year 5, year 10, year 20) and include operation, closure, and post-closure. DNR asserts that it is possible to detect and prevent any northward flowpath before any impacts are realized. Final EIS Section 5.2.2.3.6 details specific monitoring requirements, including expansion of the existing system of bedrock groundwater monitoring wells. The goal of the monitoring would be to determine"
London Bresette,"This most important discovery advanced by the Cooperating Agencies goes beyond what had been originally brought to the attention of the Co-lead Agencies; (See March 2, 2012 GLIFWC Letter on page 2949 in Appendix C of the FEIS) however, some of the previous concerns of the improper XP-SWMM modeling utilized by the applicant resulting in base flow predictions which were greatly understated, also factor into PolyMet's conclusion that there would be no northerly flow of contaminants. Given the gravity of this most recent and conclusive finding, it can only be reasonably deduced that the entire applicant's contested declarations of hypothesis, would have to be circumspect.",WAT,S,O,8,MDNR et al. 2014b
London Bresette,"The Co-lead Agencies being aware of this most important discovery forwarded by the Cooperating Agencies, proceeded in a manner that invalidates the application process by failing to properly address the environmental implications of sound scientific findings. No technical discussion exists throughout the FEIS adequately addressing these grave environmental impacts. This is tantamount to completely ignoring the issue and is contrary to NEP A Regulations and CEQ guidelines. Given the applicant is requesting permits for an open pit sulfide mine~ where its Swiss based partner Glencore-Xstrada will be extracting damage in Indian Country while exporting the copper to China, just underscores the necessity of good faith disclosure and diligent scientific transparency. nan",NEPA,S,N,8,"MDNR et al. 2015c; Although not identified as an issue for assessment in the EIS, DNR considered potential future operations at the Northshore Mine against information that is available. The agency acknowledges it cannot rule out that future operations at the Northshore Mine could induce northward groundwater bedrock flow from the NorthMet Mine Site. See Final EIS Section 6.2.2.3.1. This might happen if there is insufficient natural downward leakage into bedrock from the overlying wetlands and surficial materials between the proposed NorthMet Mine (in closure) and the Northshore Mine (in future operations and closure. If there is sufficient downward leakage, then there would be groundwater flow divide between the two mines where there is no continuous one-way flow between the facilities. If natural leakage is insufficient to maintain a groundwater flow divide between the two facilities, then the possibility a northward groundwater flowpath is present. DNR"

Both Teck (formerly Teck Cominco) and Twin Metals have claimed deposits adjoining those of PolyMet, and could foreseeably use PolyMet's excess mining capacity. The pollution potentials of a sulfide mine district, exuding acid mine drainage (AMD) and toxic heavy metals into two watersheds, could replace a wilderness environment with an industrial mining zone.

This is a conclusion that PolyMet has consistently denied, as the mining company finds it politically correct to pollute the Lake Superior watershed, but not the Rainy River, which flows into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. As reported in the Timberjay (""Tribes: FEIS water model still flawed,"" Dec. 2), ""DNR officials ... revised model runs using the water level inputs suggested by GLIFWC, and the results confirmed GLIFWC’s conclusions that groundwater from NorthMet’s east pit would flow to the north."" But rather than conduct an independent review, the DNR proposes to meet any such problems as they arise, using the catch phrase ""adaptive management.""

GLIFWC changed the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model to include future mining activity at the NorthShore Mine Peter Mitchell Pits, which is outside the scope of the EIS.

Karen Katz,"Choosing whether or not to permit this mine is the pivotal decision of the environment in northern Minnesota. If it is allowed to go through, I fear that it will be the opening of floodgates for more mining companies to step in and set up shop, ravaging the forests and lakes more and more. Usually, I take great pride in the decisions my state makes surrounding natural resources. I am especially reminded of how our state voters voted for the Legacy Amendment in 2008, when voters willingly allocated a tax increase to support environmental and cultural resources. The PolyMet mine does not reflect the values of Minnesotans and a decision in favor of the mine would jeopardize those values and the natural resources we have worked so hard to preserve. The BWCAW and the Superior National Forest are invaluable resources to people locally, statewide, nationwide, and even worldwide. The BWCAW receives more than 250,000 visitors annually, generating income and offering opportunity for thousands of people to experience the wilderness. This recreation opportunity is critical to children growing up in a world far different than the world that PolyMet owners and current DNR, Forest Service, Army Corps of Engineers, the EPA, and Minnesota State Government lead decision-makers grew up in. Access to nature is becoming harder to find and children are growing more and more disconnected from the earth. Recreation in the Boundary Waters, the forests of Northern Minnesota and on Lake Superior, is an essential opportunity to preserve for future generations, and I think the PolyMet mine puts this resource in jeopardy. I am skeptical that the opening of the mine will create sustainable jobs. Mines are boom and bust operations – once the minerals are out of the ground, the operation is over, and only those lucky folks in superior positions get to keep on. I expect the un- or under- employed people looking for work on the Iron Range will be without a job in twenty years. Twenty years isn’t even long enough to see a child through college, let alone be stable employment for future generations. So how can this mine be smart development for our economy? I think we would be better off initiating clean energy industries in the same location and training these individuals to learn those skills, instead of training them to learn the new skills needed to work on a sulfide mine.

Additionally, increased chances of extreme weather, including large precipitation events, blowdowns, and forest fires that are expected with climate change in Minnesota will increase the chances of damage to the proposed PolyMet mine and threaten the capability of any wastewater holdings tanks to contain pollution. The flow of groundwater and surface water could easily change as climate change puts pressure on natural and human systems, which means that any decision based on water flows is insufficient data in the FEIS.

Sarah Elizabeth,"I grew up on the Iron Range, about 30 miles away from the proposed Northmet site. Taconite mining is a core part of my identity. My father and grandfather both spent decades of their lives working for Minntac and Reserve Mining Co., respectively. I completely support safe and manageable modes of mining. Taconite mining put food on the table every day of my childhood and a summer job at Minntac helped me pay for college. I’m very grateful for the opportunities that mining made possible for me, and I want similar opportunities to be available to my niece and nephew and future generations. But sulfide mining, in my estimation, is drastically different from and much more dangerous than taconite mining. I think a 2008 US Fish and Wildlife-commissioned study of mining operations with acid-forming minerals best sums up why moving forward with the Northmet project would be a foolish and short-sighted decision. http://www.pebblescience.org/pdfs/Final_Lit_Review_AMD.pdf They studied the environmental impact statements and outcomes of hundreds of sulfide mining operations and found the following: “Based on review of the acid mine drainage literature it is clear that severe world-wide ecological consequences, especially for aquatic resources, have resulted from mining ore deposits with acid-forming minerals. Multiple complex geochemical, biological and hydrologic factors create a daunting task for mining engineers to profitably recover mineral resources while preventing discharges of metals and acidity to surface and ground water.” I know there are many economic challenges in northern Minnesota and I don’t have the perfect answer but I think there are other options that can bring numerous, skilled jobs to the Range for the long term and won’t threaten to turn the state’s freshwater ecosystems into Superfund sites. Instead of mining, one possibility is mineral reuse and recycling. The current percentage of copper supplied by recycled materials is approximately 30%. That percentage is expected to double in the next several decades. In other words, most of the world’s copper supply will soon be derived from copper recycling. Why not be forward-thinking and build copper (and other precious metal) recycling facilities in northern Minnesota? These could supply quality jobs for an indefinite amount of time with a drastically reduced level of environmental risk.

The final phase of development would retain an approximate 130 to 150 foot separation between the proposed mine pits and the bedrock unit. Because of this, the EIS did not require collection of new data on the Biwabik Iron Formation, but relied on existing estimates of hydraulic conductivity from a reliable source, in this case Siegel and Ericson (1980). DNR's Final SDD (section 3.3.4 Water Appropriations) identified: Mine Site - The amount of water that must be discharged to dewater the mine pit is a significant issue that will be included in the EIS. The following information will be used to better estimate this amount of water: • A report on the design and effectiveness of diking and trenching to prevent surface runoff into the pit. • A wetland hydrology study. • Hydrogeology studies of the NorthMet Deposit including the potential for water to enter the pit from the Virginia Formation. • A water balance model to estimate the quantity of water entering the pit from various sources (including direct precipitation into the pit) with consideration of seasonal changes and pit size.

Sarah Elizabeth,"In addition, Northmet’s flawed parameterization of the Peter Mitchell pits water levels and the fact that the MNDNR did not independently test Northmet’s water flow models is extremely troubling and indicates that much further analysis is needed to adequately assess the proposal’s impact. For instance, the EIS states that ‘“Site specific groundwater monitoring data and the measured lack of surface water effects near the dewatered Northshore pits are consistent with the conceptual model that downward leakage from surficial deposits into bedrock could create a groundwater mound. This would prevent the formation of a northward bedrock flowpath from the proposed NorthMet pits to the Northshore pits.” The proposal that a barrier groundwater mound would be created is unsupported by any physical models. In addition, the nature of the ‘site specific groundwater monitoring’ is not specified and is critical to the outcome of the model. In addition, the EIS acknowledges that a northward flow is possible, yet the proposed ‘adaptive mitigation measures’ – which would at that point be the last safeguard to protect ecosystems such as the BWCA – are not specified. I am troubled by the inadequacy of the model implementation by Northmet, the failure of the DNR to test the model, and the complete lack of response to these points in the FEIS.",WAT,S,N,8,MDNR et al. 2015c; DNR asserts that it is possible to detect and prevent any northward flowpath before any impacts are realized.

(2006) who conducted a detailed study of 25 mining operations involving ore with acid-bearing minerals. They found that nearly all (89%) of the mines that ultimately developed acid drainage predicted in their EIS that there was low or no potential for acid production in their operation. It is clear that, historically, EIS predictions of acid production potential are not trustworthy. 6. Kinetic tests of acid generation are variable and unreliable. See, for instance, Moring and Hutt (2000). Over a 3-7 year period, there is a 50% chance of stabilization of acid generation. Significant fluctuation was observed in half of the cells throughout the test period. 7. Lab tests of acid generation do not adequately predict long-term field acid generation. 8.

With the proposed land exchange, USFS would be forfeiting its authority to mining interests over lands that were set aside for protection.

Polymet will be mining water resources, destroying wetlands, by their own admission; and, in effect, degrading natural resources, flora and fauna, with its lease to continuously extract metals in an open-pit mine. They will be requiring permits to do all of this, including permits to take endangered species on lands that the Forest Service was given in trust, lands that USFS would need to trade in order for mining to occur.

Anita Tillemans,"The fact that the NorthMet Project prospect lies within the boundary of the Vermilion Moraine, along with the BWCAW and Ely, makes this even more difficult. The potential of water traversing aquifers through fractured metamorphic bedrock, sight unseen, is heightened. No one spot duplicates another, essentially with variations in depth to bedrock by hundreds of feet, coverage of waterlogged vegetation and lakes, and a diversity that is like no other on earth. Like faults, aquifers can be inferred invariably through their effects. Observe the copious discharge of water from the Big Stoney along the north shore of Minnesota. Observe the waters that so readily flow from the area of the Mesabi Widjiu, in rivers like Prairie River and Swan River from the Hill of Three Waters, the Vermilion River, St Louis River, Rainy River, and the great Mississippi. All one needs to do is observe. As faults and fractures allow water to disperse in bedrock, these aquifers eventually find outlet in rivers, streams, fens, wetlands, falls, ponds and lakes at varying distances and directions from the site of recharge in the Laurentian Uplands. According to the FEIS, surficial aquifers surrounding the mine site have a low conductivity, though not as low as bedrock in the same area, which supposedly decreases with depth. In this environment, then, it took thousands of years for glacial waters to make their way to the basin of Lake Superior. These waters can be seen dispersing in rich wetlands and rivers throughout; and they continue to nourish land in the Arrowhead supporting a vast and intricate ecosystem. Does it make ecological sense to place a copper mine where it can do so much harm to water resources, with the potential of collecting into highly toxic sludge, polluting more and more of the surficial aquifers of the region, as waters are made stagnant and dead over the years? There will be floods. There will be upheavals, as history proves ... waters will disperse, as it is the nature of water to do. What will be left after the mine extracts precious reserves of water from aquifers, seen and unseen, confined or not, to process metals that serve its profit margin? Will there be any wild areas left, named or unnamed, categorized or not when the pollution from concentrates, waste rock and filters have found their way through this valuable ecosystem and the watersheds of the Arrowhead? Our national security depends upon protection of freshwater resources, and the Arrowhead stands as a source of one of the largest fresh water reserves on earth. No copper mine is worth the risk of degrading this precious resource.",WAT,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WR 007
Anita Tillemans,"The FEIS notes, that approximately 1,535 acres (58 percent) of mature forest would be lost at the mine site alone, that the species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) found at the mine site would be birds from Table 4.2.5-1 and that they would be “displaced.” The FEIS goes on to state that it is likely these birds would not be injured or killed, though nesting birds could be affected. The FEIS states that the mine would not likely affect individual migratory songbirds or other bird species protected under the MBTA; but would likely affect habitat and nest sites used by them. How does one “affect” another’s home, without affecting the individual; and, as a matter of course, disturb nesting sites without disturbing the propagation of a species? With time, more species than those cited by the FEIS would be “affected” in the course of their reproductive cycles; and this, in turn, would naturally affect survival of a number of species in the area.",WI,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme WI 01
Anita Tillemans,"Recycling metals is on the upswing and processes for this type of recovery are being more fully developed as the North Met Project is being pondered.

As a consequence, copper cannot guarantee a secure future, and certainly not a green economy in the Arrowhead.",PD,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme NEPA 06
Anita Tillemans,"Statistics abound concerning the wealth of wilderness tourism; and it cannot be reconciled with a mining scenario. When the copper mines are gone, what will be left? The choice is truly between wilderness and mining. Transport down scenic highways to and from the NorthMet Project will weave a web far beyond the sites that FEIS reviewed. Tourists will be traveling down the Superior National Forest Scenic Byway, along highways and roads to Hoyt Lakes, Embarrass, Ely, Babbitt and Silver Bay. These potential long-term customers will see the effects of mining and it will affect the tourist industry. The sounds of blasting, trucks and drilling are not conducive to wilderness by any stretch; and neither is the potential of streams and waterways polluted with sulfuric acid and other toxins from mining copper. Atmospheric conditions are unpredictable and Polymet will not be able to control these. The sounds of drilling from exploratory wells for copper and other metals can be heard in the BWCAW at this time. If Polymet gets permission to pollute and take lands in the Laurentian Uplands, there will be little peace for these areas, no chance of true wilderness experience and tourism.",SO,S,O,2,SDEIS Theme SO 02

Fossil fuel needs will escalate at LTV and the mining site, fuel and coal needs for the plant and mine, fuel for the vehicles, the crushers, the earthmovers and trains. Acid rain will emerge as an even greater problem, and the FEIS did not address this issue sufficiently. Repercussions will be felt in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, most certainly, from atmospheric effects alone. Coal fired plants have provided energy to mines along the Mesabi Range for decades and, in the last 50 years, signs of acid rain have degraded foliage and forests in the path of their plumes. Witness dying birch, and mountain ash (that have all but entirely disappeared along the North Shore of Minnesota).

The effects of faults and fractures have been downplayed in models, which were made to inform the FEIS. The connectivity of bedrock with surficial aquifers assumed to be low, and the upper surface of fractured metamorphic bedrock assumed to be fractured more heavily at the top than down under. This conclusion seems convenient and arbitrary, since these structures cannot be truly known, sight unseen. Is there some reason that Polymet did not use the available information on inferred faults for more in depth field study on these particular areas? Details and independent, in depth fieldwork is still needed concerning bedrock aquifers, faults and fractures in the area because of their potential for being conduits of pollution into ground water reserves, sight unseen. Polymet admits seepage will occur, but it continues to minimize the risks through assumptions concerning the conductivity of fractured metamorphic bedrock and sand and gravel aquifers throughout the area. Water will most assuredly traverse aquifers and find the path of least resistance.

At the same time, we are assured that if there are, indeed, fractures, faults and confined aquifers found during operation, or that drawdown becomes a problem, these issues will be dealt with at the time. Of course, once an artesian has been drawn down, the chances of drawing it back up are limited.

Anita Tillemans,"In the process of review, some of the most relevant information appears to be missing from the FEIS, or discounted, much of the obvious geological and hydrological evidence that would prove a no action alternative best for the environment and for the habitants upstream and downstream of the proposed mining project. For instance, significant evidence on the fractured metamorphic nature of these lands, inferred and actual fractures and faults that have been named, the prospect of artesian springs, other faults and fractures in bedrock that may conduct water from the site, the potential that water inflows are much greater by many accounts have been given short shrift in deference to a computer model fed with data chosen, in particular, for this study. It all seems quite arbitrary, and these omissions are significant. The area that includes Babbitt, Hoyt Lakes and the transportation corridor are covered with sand and gravel surficial aquifers, which run the possibility of overdevelopment in irrigated areas. This region also includes igneous and fractured metamorphic bedrock aquifers, where water can be found in cracks, joints and fractures within otherwise solid rock formations. Hoyt Lakes is a land of sand and gravel buried aquifers, which can be a major source of water (eg the Biwabik formation). Further down the St Louis River, in addition to sand and gravel surficial, and buried aquifers, igneous and fractured metamorphic bedrock aquifers, there are also sedimentary bedrock aquifers. Even though yields from these sedimentary cretaceous deposits are supposed to be low, the possibility that ground water discharges in lowlands from sand and gravel and fractured aquifers, also in the area, certainly exists.",WAT,S,O,3,SDEIS Theme WR 007

The Mississippi is now polluted; the St Louis River, and waters off the North Shore are imperiled. One hundred years is so little time in the course of a history like the Arrowhead, but much damage has already been done. What would be the result after 500 years of seepage from the degraded rotted and rusted infrastructure of a copper sulfide mine?

Anita Tillemans,"Exploratory wells have been made well past the northern boundaries of the St Louis River Watershed, into the Rainy River Watershed, and on the boundary of the BWCAW. As a consequence, if the North Met project for a copper mine is granted, this will create the potential of a succession of mining pits and wells that move from the NE of Giants Ridge into the domain of the BWCA Wilderness. Consequently, the NorthMet Project prospect has the potential of affecting a larger area than the study proposes. Elevated levels of arsenic can be found in the BWCAW along with brackish waters from exploratory wells. These details cannot be overlooked because it foretells the real possibility of pollution from Polymet’s mine pits traversing aquifers and connecting the St Louis Watershed to the Rainy River Watershed.

The NorthMet Project Proposed Action relies on mechanical treatment for as long as necessary. FEIS Chapter 3 states that PolyMet has committed to conducting pilot and other feasibility studies on the use of non- mechanical treatment as an adaptive management measure if proven effective and cost efficient. The possible future use of non-mechanical treatment is stated as a long-term goal, but the details of how such systems would operate would be determined once operations begin and site specific data could be used for pilot/feasibility studies, and if eventually proposed would be addresses in future permitting.

A large buttress is needed on the north side due the height of the proposed dam (250 feet), the existing materials the dam is built upon (peat in the base), and the thickness and characteristics of the materials of LTV dams that Polymet will be built upon. The large buttress is needed to bring the FS up to the required standards. On the north side the dam will be about 250 feet at final height while on the south side, the height will be closer to 150. The dam on the north will be built on softer peat and tailings while the dam on the south will be built on a mixture of high ground and a rock stockpile used to support the railroad. The base on the south is also much wider than the base on the north. Therefore, a smaller buttress is needed to meet the Factor of Safety requirements.

Lori Andresen,"The PolyMet final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was released to the public November 6th, 2015. How did PolyMet ever get this far? And why? In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated PolyMet's draft EIS as EU-3, Environmentally Unsatisfactory-Inadequate. Here are some quotes from the comments: ""The EPA believes that the project will exceed water quality standards because of discharges during the life of the mining operation and on a long-term basis, including the post-closure period. These water quality impacts are largely related to water that contacts acid-generating waste rock ... and to wastewater escaping the tailings basin through seeps and in ground water. ...the analyses of the hydrogeological profiles at both the mine and processing site are inadequate to determine the full extent of impacts or to justify mitigation options. Consequently we believe that the DEIS likely underestimates water quality impacts and the project is likely to have additional unmitigated long-term discharges. EPA has identified information gaps relating to groundwater impacts, groundwater-surface water interaction, tailings basin stability and containment, and groundwater discharges to surface water. Furthermore, EPA does not agree with the compensation described for wetlands impacts... The DEIS did not provide information on financial assurance..."" The above are the same concerns brought forth by environmental groups as they made their way through hundreds of pages of the DEIS. These concerns included: ""There is inadequate analysis. There is no substance to conclusions that claim there will be no water pollution. The scale of the mining operation is such that it will be impossible to contain water pollution. The tailings basin purchased from the former LTV Mining Company by PolyMet is already leaching sulfates and other pollutants into the watershed and is not designed to contain the amount or type of tailings that would be produced by PolyMet. The wetland loss at PolyMet’s NorthMet mine (nearly 1,000 acres direct/ 6,500 acres indirect) would be the single largest loss ever permitted by the St. Paul Army Corps of Engineers. The US Forest Service could deny an open pit mine operation on our public lands within Superior National Forest, rather than negotiating a land exchange that would privatize 6,500 acres of Superior National Forest lands, impacting wildlife and wildlife corridors.

Lori Andresen,"The PolyMet project should have been shelved in 2010. Instead, the Supplementary Draft EIS was released in December of 2013. In preliminary documents circulated prior to the SDEIS, environmental groups noticed that water treatment would be needed for at least 200 years at the mine site and at least 500 years at the plant site. PolyMet’s plan for perpetual treatment at its sulfide mine should not have been allowed to proceed, as long term treatment goes against Minnesota state law (CHAPTER 6132, NONFERROUS METALLIC MINERAL MINING, 6132.3200 CLOSURE AND POSTCLOSURE MAINTENANCE. Subpart 1. Goal. The mining area shall be closed so that it is stable, free of hazards, minimizes hydrologic impacts, minimizes the release of substances that adversely impact other natural resources, and is maintenance free.) But instead, the agencies relegated the water treatment statement to one mention within the depths of the SDEIS, claiming that only passive water treatment would be needed at the mine site, and relying on Reverse Osmosis (RO) water treatment at the plant site, post closure. The Dunka mine site, where LTV Mining Company removed some layers of sulfide-bearing rock in order to extract the taconite underneath, is a clear indication that passive water treatment is not enough. Toxic heavy metals continue to drain from the Dunka mine waste rock into Bob Bay of Birch Lake. The passive water treatment proposed by the DNR appears to be dilution, as the contamination seeps into wetlands and eventually into a larger body of water. Active water treatment proved too expensive for the mining company, and the DNR has allowed the use of man-made wetlands as a stop gap solution to the ongoing pollution; these wetland materials need to be periodically dredged, removed, and then replaced with new material. (For more information, see ""Mining Vs Water, Dunka site exposes breakdown in mine regulation,"" Timberjay 10-7-15.) The reverse osmosis (RO) pilot test that was prepared for PolyMet by Barr Engineering does not reflect the quantity or quality of water that would need to be treated upon mine closure. It is known that RO is not effective on a large mining scale, as it is too costly, and because the concentration trapped in the RO filters is highly toxic and needs special containment. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency exempted Mesabi Nugget from using RO as ""not technically feasible"" and because it ""would cause the discharger undue hardship."" In other words, RO was rejected due to the uncertainty of its effectiveness and its prohibitive cost. (Mesabi Nugget Delaware, LLC NPDES/SDS Permit No. MN0067687, pages 6-9, October 12, 2012) In addition, RO might be a moot point.

Lori Andresen,"Muddying the Toxic Waters. The SDEIS should have been the end of PolyMet. But instead, the final EIS (FEIS) has been publically released. Already, in preliminary documents reviewed over the summer, the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC) has found major discrepancies in the water modeling. GLIFWC's results using the same water modeling program done for PolyMet by Barr Engineering found that, upon closure, and due to the proximity and interconnectedness of PolyMet and the Peter Mitchell taconite mine at Babbitt, water from PolyMet would flow north into the Rainy River watershed. This would increase pollution to both the Rainy River and Lake Superior watersheds; while adding pollution to the Rainy River watershed, water would be drained from the Lake Superior watershed, leaving the pollution there more concentrated. In its faulty final EIS process, the DNR is circumventing this information, and rather than running its own modeling, is relying on something called ""adaptive management,"" a concept that allows them to adapt to a problem as it comes up. But the DNR record shows limited success in problem solving. Right now, all six taconite mines are operating under expired permits or variances--whereby the mine can continue polluting while claiming it will comply with standards somewhere down the line. In effect, the taconite mines have been allowed to continue mining and to expand without meeting existing environmental standards. For example, the issue of mercury and sulfates impacting our fish and wild rice has not been resolved. The DNR is attempting to figure out how to control ongoing sulfate pollution from Minntac's tailings basin, while at the same time allowing Minntac to add more tailings as it expands. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency is being pressured by legislators to lower or adjust the sulfate standard in order to accommodate mining expansion. Proposed adjusting of the standard to fit various waterways would be basically impossible to monitor or enforce--thus perpetuating the problems caused from mining pollution. Yet the same agencies that have failed to control taconite pollution are now set to permit higher polluting sulfide mining.",WAT,S,O,8,"SDEIS Themes WR 023, WR 106"

In August of 2014, a breach in the tailings basin at the Mount Polley Mine in British Columbia became the largest mining waste spill in Canada's history. Despite approval to restart, there are still no long-term plans regarding site clean-up costs, water treatment, and mining wastes management. (""No Reason to Celebrate One Year After Mt. Polley Disaster"" Mining Watch Canada, July 31, 2015) After the Mount Polley disaster, a panel of experts recommended using a filtering process to dry stack tailings, which would be much less of a risk for dam failure than the current wet tailings. Mining companies in Canada are resisting this improvement as being too costly in a wet environment. PolyMet has also rejected using such a system at their proposed NorthMet Mine. All six of Minnesota's taconite tailings basins are wet, potentially placing them at risk for breaches. NorthShore Mining's Milepost 7 tailings basin is particularly precarious, as a dam break would send the tailings downhill and directly into Lake Superior. On February 2, 2012, HibTac discovered a crack on the Western Dam South, which extended approximately 1,000 linear feet, resulting in discharges into adjacent wetlands, as reported by the Army Corps of Engineers, 2012 -00623-DWW. The former LTV Steel Company tailings basin purchased by PolyMet has already been faulted for being unstable. In PolyMet's case, the problem is more serious due to the low grade nature of the copper-nickel mineralization (less than 1%) and the great amount of waste material (99%) and the heavy metals and contaminants associated with the sulfides that would be added to the existing taconite tailings basin. As further evidence of ongoing sulfide mining pollution, a U.S. mining disaster occurred in August of 2015 when 3 million gallons of wastewater and sludge from the dormant Gold King Mine poured into a tributary of the Animas River in Colorado. Workers for the EPA were trying to install a pipe to drain water from the abandoned mine so that they could eventually plug the mine and prevent contaminated water from seeping out. Instead, the force of the water broke through the existing dam, turning the entire river a bright orange with mine waste pollution. Unfortunately, this whole western region is riddled with abandoned mines, all seeping into ground and surface waters, while the EPA is lacking in money to clean up these super-fund sites.",GT,S,O,8,SDEIS Theme GT 01
Lori Andresen,"What kind of financial assurance would PolyMet need to post in order to cover potential tailings basin failure, as well as covering over 500 years (virtually forever) of water treatment? This issue isn't even addressed in PolyMet's FEIS. Instead it will be negotiated between the DNR Division of Lands and Minerals and PolyMet--both with immediate and direct interest in the permitting of PolyMet.",FIN,S,O,5,SDEIS Theme FIN 01
Lori Andresen,"Market Weakness. Of further concern are weak market conditions for metals. Glencore, the major investor in PolyMet, has lost 60% of its share value over the past year. The company over-expanded when the market was high, taking on a debt load that has now become a burden. Any delay or problems in PolyMet's NorthMet project might mean that Glencore would pull out of the project in an attempt to further dump its debt. See ""Counterpoint: PolyMet's Minnesota copper-nickel project is risky business,"" Star Tribune, October 28, 2015 for more information.",O,NS,X,1,
Lori Andresen,"Summary. Decisions are being made right now that will likely impact the next 25 generations to inhabit this area. We are placing our immediate desire for metals above the long-term need for clean water. Decision makers are swallowing the philosophy of mass consumerism that requires ever-expanding consumption of goods--a concept which is out of balance with the natural world and resources of the planet. We currently do not have the technology to mine highly disseminated low grade metals out of sulfide ores without degrading and polluting our environment for the next 500 years (or longer). Nor do we have the technology or the political will to clean up the pollution that is already here. Northeast Minnesota contains the headwaters of three great watersheds--north to Rainy River, east to Lake Superior, and south to the Mississippi. The Arrowhead has been known as one of the most magnificent areas of the state, for its majestic forests, wetlands, and waters. Superior National Forest is a treasure for the citizens of this state and nation. We all bear responsibility for what we will leave behind for the generations ahead. Clean water is a valuable resource in its own right. It is time to say ""No"" to PolyMet for once and for all. Take the time to submit a comment on the PolyMet FEIS, which was released on November 6. No public meetings have been scheduled during the comment period, ending on December 14. Check www.sosbluewaters.org or other environmental sites for more information.",O,NS,X,1,
Brad Sagen,"Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC) has notified the lead agencies that groundwater from the NorthMet east pit is predicted to flow northward into the Rainy River Basin upon closure of the Northshore Peter Mitchell Mine. The agencies acknowledge this possibility but have refused to conduct necessary additional analysis. According to an interagency memo of 10/12/15, “the well data and the NorthMet Mine Site MODFLOW model do not exclude the possibility of a future northward bedrock flowpath from the proposed NorthMet pits to the Northshore pits.” The point central to an evaluation of the adequacy of the FEIS is that because of the level of risk involved, the possibility of northward east pit groundwater flow must be addressed in the FEIS.",WAT,S,N,8,MDNR et al. 2015c. DNR disagrees with GLIFWC’s application of the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model
Brad Sagen,"The FEIS relies upon “contingency mitigation” where water quality is “worse than expected” or as a result of “compliance issues” (FEIS, 5-239 to 5-240). The FEIS provides no information that mitigation is feasible or would be effective. The FEIS states, “The exact type, location, scale, and timing of mitigation measures are not known at this time.” (FEIS, 5-240).",ALT,S,N,8,MDNR et al. 2015c
Brad Sagen,"Contingency mitigation may be considered a strategically chosen alternative phrase to “adaptive management.” The latter, while undefined in the SDEIS, is part of USFS regulations and policy, and would have subjected the FEIS to more systematic scrutiny. FEIS pronouncements about contingency mitigation should be subjected to analysis using USFS guidelines about adaptive management.",ALT,S,N,11,
Brad Sagen,"EPA, as well as several environmental organizations, have called attention to the absence of virtually any information regarding the need for financial assurance and the capacity of the proponent firm(s) to provide that assurance. While a detailed financial assurance plan may not be required prior to permitting, the capacity of proponents to provide such assurance should be considered part of a determination of FEIS adequacy.",FIN,NS,X,1,

Best management practices that would have created a new tailings waste facility were ignored. This must be considered in a ‘revised’ or supplementary FEIS.",GT,NS,X,1,
Rick Billmeier,"I am writing to let you know that I am strongly against allowing any copper nickel mining in or near BWCA or the Superior National Forest. I have researched sulfide mining trying to understand how anyone that cares about the future of Minnesota can seriously consider allowing such a risky proposal. I do not think the FEIS can claim that it has done an ""intensive, scientific examination of environmental, social and economic aspects of the proposed project,"" by using, or relying in any way, on the self-interested ""water model"" or any other claims made by PolyMet or its consultants. I believe Minnesota should require a higher standard and demand actual proof BEFORE issuing any mining permits!",GEN,NS,X,1,
Rick Billmeier,"I support the creation of a Minnesota Statute similar to Wisconsin's 1997 ""mining moratorium"" law. Minnesota should adopt a similar statute that prohibits the granting of a mining permit unless the permittee can show: 1) that an existing mine has operated in a sulfide ore body for 10 years without polluting the ground or surface water; and 2) that a mine that operated in a sulfide ore body and has been closed for 10 years has not completed the ground or surface water. Historically, the environmental review process has been unable to PREDICT the actual impacts of sulfide mining in water rich environments and has underestimated the impacts as well as the cost of clean-up. At the very least, Minnesotans should require proof, in the form of documented actual prior experience, that Poly Met has been able to do the proposed sulfide mining somewhere else without creating sulfuric acid or Acid Mine Drainage in toxic levels.",PER,S,O,6,"SDEIS Themes CU18, CU19"
Faye Topliff,"We have a 40 acre parcel in the area of Polymets proposed EXTRACTION PIT. We also live downstream in Duluth and this project could mess up the whole area. My kids, relatives, others love the BWCA. So we follow with great interest any proposed swap. With everything I have been able to find out, it seems as though the Polymet project is a poorly thought out project. To deposit toxic waste in a pit that already leaks is a bad idea to start with and then looking at the published maps it would seem as though Polymet is not disclosing their exact Dump site. Why would anyone want to swap land for a project that has engineers that designed a pit in British Columbia that failed terribly. There is NO room for error on this extraction project. Polymet will have many toxic chemicals in their waste. My family was here for the big Reserve Mining screw up in Lake Superior. Remember Asbestos! It cost us private citizens much time and money to get the dumping out of the lake. The lake still suffers. Also what Polymet wants to do is not iron ore mining or taconite. It is extraction with too much waste to handle. Why would we think that we would have the right to contaminate Minnesota far into the future? Would tourists come by the planeload to canoe, swim and recreate in our fouled waters? Our necessities for life are clean air and clean water. There are already places that do not have either of these. They are priceless.",GEN,NS,X,1,
Ashlee Kveton,"However, I must admit I have serious doubts about the copper nickel mine that Poly Met has proposed. Further, I have serious doubts about the integrity of the lead agencies Environmental review process and it's subsequent EIS's and their predictions/conclusions. First of all, I lived in Montana for quite some time where the environmental, and public health consequences of mines just like the one proposed by Poly Met induced Montanan's who are largely Pro Industry- to pass a ballot Initiative I-137 in 1998 banning -cyanide leach mining- which in all reality poses the exact same dangers that the copper nickel mine Poly Met is proposing. See the cyanide goes away but what is left is the same thing we have to worry about with Poly Met's Proposed project- sulfide bearing waste rock (like what Poly Met is mining) that reacts with air and water to produce acid runoff and also all kinds of nasty toxins like Arsenic that destroy down stream aquatic ecosystems.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Ashlee Kveton,"I fear that like the mines in Montana, the Gilt Edge mine in Lead South Dakota, Poly Met cannot stop the toxic runoff from their waste rock piles from seeping into groundwater, being flushed downstream, or even entering the BWCA watershed via groundwater flow and movement in the 100 mile swamp-which looks to flow into the St. Louis river/Lake Superior Watershed, as well as, the Rainy River/Hudson's Bay Watershed. As I understand it the stream flow data that Poly Met gathered is a very inaccurate representation of what is actually happening at the Poly Met site. This of course is the same data that The lead agencies used to predict the flow of water, and toxins into the environment. This is unacceptable. Also, the Environmental Review process should be taking into account changes in ground water flow and tables, relating to other mining related disturbances/influences on the flow of water during and after the life of the Poly Met Mine. Such as a draw down of 200-300 feet in a mine pit lake north of the Poly Met site-which arguably will cause the groundwater from Poly Met to flow North into the Rainy River watershed instead of south into the St. Louis River system.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Ashlee Kveton,"Further, I am outraged when I read the shear volume of untreated polluted water that will by the lead agencies own admission be leaving the mining operation and entering the environment, whether it goes to the BWCA or the Lake Superior. The St. Louis River deserves every protection that a river flowing into the BWCA does. For one thing alot more people live down stream of the St. Louis River than down stream from the Rainy. I personally rely on fish from both watersheds-and am a woman of child bearing age. I should not have to worry about my elected public and appointed public officials making it more dangerous than it already is to consume an important source of calories and nutrition that helps me get by on a lower income.",HU,NS,X,1,
Ashlee Kveton,"When it comes to copper nickel mining on the Iron Range we only get one chance to do it right. We have to ask ourselves do we really want to stake the future of copper nickel mining in Minnesota on the Shoulders of a company like Poly Met. Poly Met has never run a mine before, a Poly Met is not Minnesota based, a Poly Met seem more than happy to supply suspect data to the public agencies tasked with protecting our environment, Poly Met chose to propose the cheapest ( and, also the most environmentally damaging) type of mine to open (aka open pit mine) despite safer alternatives being known, and also while knowing full well that the technology/type of extraction/processing/waste this mine will produce has proven unsafe for the environment repeatedly.",PD,NS,X,1,
Ashlee Kveton,"Poly Met claims they can remove these metals and all that waste rock containing sulfides safely and yet, the lead agencies predict that the site will require expensive water treatment for at least 500 years.",PD,NS,X,1,
Ashlee Kveton,"Is 20 years of mine life and the associated jobs really worth 500 years at least of water treatment from this site, Is it worth the massive plumes of untreated water from this site contaminating ground water, and eventually surface water resources, when the plumes reach the lakes and rivers we swim in and eat from? By approving this FEIS and the associated known- and possible effects of this mine Tom Landwehr and the rest of the lead agency staff is sending the message to Minnesotans that anyone with a lot of money can come into Minnesota and take whatever they want from us at the expense of our communities, our environment, and those Minnesotan's who will come after us.",WAT,NS,X,1,
Ashlee Kveton,"I say Iron Rangers and Minnesotan's deserve better. We deserve clean water, and we should not give it away for the price of boom and bust economics, that leave our communities destitute and polluted. The lead agencies need to reject this FEIS as inadequate and demand Poly Met give Minnesotans what we deserve. If Poly Met wants the Metals in our ground they need to prove that they can remove it safely and leave Minnesota with a site that does not require treatment 500 or more years into the future. So far Poly Met has failed miserably to earn my trust. I simply do not believe they care one little bit about Minnesota or it's Iron Rangers. They disrespect us if they think they can come here and do any kind of resource extraction that requires indefinite treatment for 100's of years into the future, and pollute the resources we cherish most as Minnesotan's, our lands, our waters, and our outdoor heritage. Our elected officials need to pull their proverbial heads out of their proverbial %$^&%^&, Yes jobs on the range are needed, but not at this cost. The writing is on the wall, Rebecca Otto, the state auditor, looked at this project entirely from an economic stand point and concluded it was a bad deal for Minnesota. We do not have to say No to all future developments, but we need to examine them thoroughly and objectively. Poly Met as currently drawn up is bound to be an environmental and economic blunder, there is no available evidence, aka other mines of this type to show that it can be done responsibly.

Dennis Good,"Nice touch, releasing the FEIS late on a Friday afternoon to take advantage of what’s commonly known as “ The Friday Night News Dump” wherein controversial news is released late on a Friday in the hope that it will be downplayed, missed or overtaken by other events. An even nicer touch is releasing it on the Friday before deer season when people will be occupied for the next 2 weeks and 3 weekends. After that is the run-up to Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday etc. etc. An added bonus is that this comment period runs concurrently with the comment period on the 10mg/l sulfate standard, another momentous issue. Coincidence? One would have to be virginally naïve to believe that. This was done deliberately to eat up time before the comment period ends, reduce the amount of time a person has available to go through this lengthy document and generally, to attempt to stifle debate. Most people won’t get through the Executive Summary anyway (which is basically a written pep rally for the project), but even if you’re curious you’ll most likely never make it to the Financial Assurance and the Land Exchange sections.",GEN,NS,X,1,
Dennis Good,"Tactics like this are not new for this project. Anyone who has been involved with it or kept tabs on it knows this. Ignoring the 10mg/l sulfate standard; trying to keep the Land Exchange out of the EIS as a connected action; St. Louis County attempting to secure wetland mitigation acreage for Polymet without environmental review or public notice; the petty revenge taken against the State Auditor for daring to question the lack of Financial Assurance details; the endless propaganda from Polymet and its supporters designed to trumpet the economic benefits (which are cruel illusions) while downplaying and minimizing the environmental impacts which are real and dangerous; the hijacking of a special election endorsement process in Northern Minnesota to ensure the election of a Polymet supporter and the recent revelations that not only did Barr Engineering botch the water modeling between the East Pit and the Peter Mitchell Pit, the Co-Lead Agencies (our “Regulatory Agencies”) never bothered to run any of the water models themselves as they are required to do by law. And the fact that this water will flow north, eventually into the BWCA, is not mentioned in the FEIS. Not only does this call into question all the water modeling but it also begs the question of where the Co-Lead Agencies loyalties lie.",FIN,NS,X,1,
Dennis Good,"These are only a few examples of why the preparation of this EIS should have been sent out of state. There is a precedent for this. I was involved in the “MINNTAC Water Diversion Project” DEIS (ca.2006). This project was considered so controversial, certain officials in the MPCA decided to send the DEIS preparation out of state and to hold open and fair public meetings. This helps to minimize bias, preordained outcomes, political meddling and conflicts of interest. The contrasts between that MINNTAC EIS process and this NorthMet EIS process couldn’t be more stark. The NorthMet EIS has been prepared by and overseen by two entities that stand to make a lot of money if this project is permitted. This would be Barr Engineering and the MNDNR. The conflicts of interest are obvious. And with the Co-Lead Agencies preparing position papers for Polymet, in essence working for Polymet and abandoning all the due diligence they’re required to exercise by law, one can easily see how dirty and corrupt this process has become.",GEN,NS,X,1,
Dennis Good,"If you do make it to the Financial Assurance section, it’s easy to get through because there’s virtually nothing there. It’s the same nonsense from the SDEIS; “surety bonds, irrevocable letters of credit, cash and cash equivalents, trust funds, insurance policies”. There’s not a tangible asset in sight. This is nothing but worthless paper and the passage of time (200+years) won’t improve its worth. These are the same toxic waste products that Wall Street has been peddling since day one. The SDEIS says “the amount of Financial Assurance associated with reclamation actions cannot be estimated until these actions are understood at a more detailed level of design.” The FEIS says “The level of engineering design and planning required to calculate detailed Financial Assurance amounts is not currently available but it would be evaluated in detail during the permitting process”. If the SDEIS and FEIS statements are true, then Polymet and the Co-Lead Agencies are trying to bypass the NEPA process. They are also trying to conceal from the public the true costs of this project. If a “detailed level of design” is not available for Financial Assurance purposes, then how is it available for determining the impacts of the mine during operations? If detailed Financial Assurance amounts are not “currently available”, then this project is fundamentally and irretrievably flawed.",FIN,NS,X,1,
Dennis Good,"Under MN Rule 6132.3200, “To receive a permit to mine, the permittee must be able to close the mine in such a way that it is stable, free of hazards, minimizes hydrological impact and the release of substances and is maintenance free”. I can’t see any of these conditions being met and judging by the comment letters I’ve read, neither can anyone else. Has this rule changed?",PER,NS,X,1,
Dennis Good,"It is known that Polymet has private lease agreements with mineral rights owners S.W. of the West Pit. It seems that the West Pit will become at some point, a new opening for new mining activities. I didn’t see this mentioned in the FEIS. It sounds like a reasonably foreseeable future action to me.",PD,NS,X,1,
Dennis Good,"As far as the Land Exchange is concerned, I see that the USFS has already run up the white flag of surrender and adopted Polymet’s Need and Purpose in toto. In effect, the USFS is letting a private corporation dictate what is done with public land and public resources when it has no right to do so. The excuse the USFS is using is a fear of litigation with “no certain outcome” and having judicial precedents set concerning Weeks Act Lands. Someone wasn’t thinking this issue through. The USFS has now set a precedent. All a company has to do from now on is bluster about “fundamental conflicts” and threaten litigation and Voila! Mission accomplished. As far as litigation is concerned, all the summaries of court decisions I’ve seen say that a right to surface mine must be expressly reserved in the deed. If a right to surface mine is not reserved in the deed then surface mining is not allowed. Polymet’s deed has no such provision for strip mining. The original parties to the deed knew that the United States under the Weeks Act was acquiring this land for forestry and watershed protection and surface mining is inimical to forestry practices and watershed protection.",LAN,NS,X,1,
Dennis Good,"In essence, the USFS has and the other Co-Lead Agencies are going to put a bar code on the Superior National Forest. But there’s a way out of this. This isn’t my idea; it was in a letter to the editor of one of the state newspapers. I’ll call it Amendment A to the No-Build Alternative. Staffing levels at this mine are projected to be around 360 employees. Set up some criteria (disabled veterans and/or unemployed veterans should go to the head of the line) and pay these 360 people $ 50,000.00 dollars a year for 20 years. Since this will be a scab operation and the median income for St. Louis County is around $ 45,000.00 a year, $ 50,000.00 will work out nicely and is a nice round number. Since the “Financial Assurance” will consist of worthless paper, no matter what the amount is, the state and its taxpayers will come out of this smelling like a rose. This is a No-Lose Alternative; simple yet brilliant and I commend the person whose idea it was. And it has the added effect of allowing the Co-Lead Agencies to step back from the brink before it’s too late.",ALT,NS,X,1,

Multiple,"The PolyMet Final EIS (FEIS) should be rejected as incomplete because it fails to accurately model water seepage from the tailings basin, some of which will flow north towards the Boundary Waters Wilderness, due to alteration of the Laurentian Divide from nearby taconite mining. The mine proposal does not detail plans to protect the Boundary Waters from centuries of toxic drainage. Instead, it assumes the planned clay-lined trench will collect 100% of groundwater seepage (Figure 3.2-28) which is patently impossible, and it requires only monitoring of groundwater flows leading north to the Boundary Waters (p 3-150, Section 3.2.3.3.4).
