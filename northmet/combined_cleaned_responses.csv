Inflows to the pits include contributions from groundwater and runoff within the pit.

Pump capacities are based on peak annual flows from the snowmelt event, assuming a rapid spring snowmelt (40% of the snowmelt occurring within one day). The pumping systems are designed to handle groundwater inflows and the average annual runoff volumes from a snowmelt event, removing approximately 100% of the groundwater inflows and 40% of the annual snowmelt runoff (1.28 inches) within 3 days. The volume from this snowmelt event is approximately equivalent to the runoff volume expected in the pits"

It is correct that the Final EIS analysis does not include specific discussions on SO2 or sulfur aerosol mist (SAM) impacts to “wetlands,” although it does include discussion on impacts to lakes. The Final EIS does, however, include a discussion of the impacts to wetlands from the larger source of sulfur from particulates and fugitive dust (> approximately 80% of calculated potential sulfate additions). Considering another qualitative, but smaller, increment from SO2 and/or SAM to the quantitative impact analysis already conducted for particulate sulfur on wetlands in the FEIS does not change the overall conclusions of that analysis.  Emissions of mercury from the mine would be addressed in permitting. MPCA would determine, in the course of its decision-making for a permit governing air emissions, what regulations or controls should be imposed upon potential sources of mercury that could impact water resources, including fugitive emissions. Similarly, potential water quality concerns associated with mercury, sulfate, and methylmercury, would be addressed in the context of NPDES permitting as well as wetlands permitting, which could include the details of potential water quality monitoring."

Some aspects of the analyses do involve a degree of scientific uncertainty and that certain variables and conclusions are subject to interpretation. Even with these uncertainties in the analyses there is still high confidence in the overall determination presented in the Final EIS that the project will not result in adverse effects on downstream fish-tissue mercury levels or on the associated human health concerns of fish consumption. By reducing the contribution of sulfate in the Embarrass River watershed relative to current levels, the project is also consistent with the goals of the MPCA strategy (2006a) to address the indirect effects of sulfate on methyl mercury production for ""high risk"" settings such as exists over portions of the NorthMet project area."

Comment noted. DNR asserts it is reasonable for the Final EIS to rely on the USEPA-established pMCL (primary Maximum Contaminant Level) of 10 μg/L as the evaluation criteria for arsenic; see Final EIS Table 5.2.2-2. See Thematic Response WR 123. Also noteworthy is that the reverse osmosis pilot plant results using water from NorthMet Project Proposed Action site have demonstrated the ability of the treatment technology to meet water quality standards. Arsenic is expected to be removed primarily across the greensand filter, rather than the RO unit. Removal of arsenic by the greensand filter of up to 99.68% was observed on the pilotscale (Barr 2013f)."

negligent,WAT,S,N,8,"MDNR et al. 2015c. DNR disagrees with GLIFWC’s application of the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model because that agency modified the model outside its intended purpose as defined in Final SDD Section 6.2. The Final SDD required the groundwater flow model to predict pit inflows at various stages of pit development (i.e., year 1, year 5, year 10, year 20) and include operation, closure, and post-closure. The model satisfies this condition of the final scoping decision. GLIFWC changed the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model to include future mining activity at the NorthShore Mine Peter Mitchell Pits, which is outside the scope of the EIS. If the EIS scope were defined to assess of how future activity at the Peter Mitchell Pit might influence the closure conditions at the NorthMet site, then additional data would be required north of the Mine Site on which to refine the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model for : 1) vertical hydraulic conductivity for wetlands and surficial deposits; 2) horizontal hydraulic conductivities in bedrock (e.g., Virginia Formation; BIF); 3) variability of hydraulic conductivities within the bedrock units, and 4) the hydrologic significance of 100 Mile Swamp in providing a source of water for downward leakage. Each of these refinements is important to quantitatively assess the likelihood and potential magnitude of a northward bedrock flowpath. Modeling would also have to reconcile uncertainty regarding the sequence and timing of future Northshore mining operations, including the depth of pit excavations and development of pit lakes relative to NorthMet-related pit conditions during operations and closure. Absent these changes, the results of GLIFWC’s modeling is unreliable for impact assessment. Although not identified as an issue for assessment in the EIS, DNR considered potential future operations at the Northshore Mine against information that is available. DNR acknowledges"

DNR acknowledges that it cannot rule out that future operations at the Northshore Mine could induce northward groundwater bedrock flow from the NorthMet Mine Site. See Final EIS Section 6.2.2.3.1. This might happen if there is insufficient natural downward leakage into bedrock from the overlying wetlands and surficial materials between the proposed NorthMet Mine (in closure) and the Northshore Mine (in future operations and closure. If there is sufficient downward leakage, then there would be groundwater flow divide between the two"

john.coleman,more highly conductive bedrock north scale flow polymet pits when pm pits set correct closure levels appears approximately order magnitude greater quantity flow previously considered feis contaminant transport south,WAT,S,N,12,"DNR has not assessed the potential quantity of water that might be associated with a potential northward groundwater flow in bedrock under Peter Mitchell Pit closure conditions. DNR acknowledges that absent changes in modeling assumptions in the EIS MODFLOW model that flow rates would be commensurate with rates associated with the Proposed Project condition. Depending on the natural downward flux from the surficial materials into bedrock, this rate of flow might be lessened. The rate would also lessen as the Northshore Mine pit lake fills to its outlet elevation of 1,500 ft amsl. DNR’s concession that northward flow between the NorthMet Mine and Northshore Mine is possible is not based on modeling. There is no potential for northward flow until mining in the Northshore pits results in water levels (at Northshore) below the water levels of the proposed NorthMet pits. When and if this might occur is not precisely known but it is most likely to occur after the proposed NorthMet Mine East Pit (of particular interest) has been reclaimed in mine year 20. DNR asserts that any such phenomena can be detected, and if detected, it can be prevented."

DNR asserts that it is possible to detect and prevent any northward flowpath before any impacts are realized. Final EIS Section 5.2.2.3.6 details specific monitoring requirements, including expansion of the existing system of bedrock groundwater monitoring wells. The goal of the monitoring would be to determine future bedrock flow direction immediately north of the NorthMet pits to identify any need for engineered preventive mitigation measures. Final EIS Section 5.2.2.3.5 identifies known measures that could be applied if a potential for northward flow was detected."

DNR notes the Mine Site MODFLOW model reflects available information between the proposed NorthMet project site and the Northshore Peter Mitchell Mine pits. Even with improved data and analytical techniques, proximity alone to a taconite facility does automatically result in commensurate effects to local hydrology. There is no evidence that the Partridge River, 100 Mile Swamp, or Argo and Iron Lakes, have been measurably impacted by Northshore Mining activity to date; whether this would hold into the future is uncertain.

DNR asserts the information allows adequate consideration of factors related to the sizing and effectiveness of the proposed WWTF system consistent with the Final SDD. DNR has not assessed the potential quantity of water that might be associated with a potential northward groundwater flow in bedrock under Peter Mitchell Pit closure conditions. Although not assessed quantitatively, DNR has considered potential future operations at the Northshore Mine against information that is available. DNR acknowledges it cannot rule out that future operations at the Northshore Mine could induce northward groundwater bedrock flow from the NorthMet Mine Site. See Final EIS Section 6.2.2.3.1. This might happen if there is insufficient natural downward leakage into bedrock from the overlying wetlands and surficial materials between the proposed NorthMet Mine (in closure) and the Northshore Mine (in future operations and closure). If there is sufficient downward leakage, then there would be groundwater flow divide between the two mines where there is no continuous one-way flow between the facilities. If natural leakage is insufficient to maintain a groundwater flow divide between the two facilities, then it is possible a northward groundwater flowpath would be present. DNR asserts that it is possible to detect and prevent any northward flowpath before any impacts are realized. Regarding detection of any northward flow, it is reasonable for the Final EIS to detail in Section 5.2.2.3.6 specific monitoring requirements, including expansion of the existing system of bedrock groundwater monitoring wells. The goal of the monitoring would be to determine future bedrock flow direction immediately north of the NorthMet pits to identify any need for engineered preventive mitigation measures. Regarding prevention of any northward flow, it is reasonable for the Final EIS to detail in Section 5.2.2.3.5 the types of known measures that could be applied if a potential for northward flow is detected. The possibility of northward flow between the proposed NorthMet Mine and Northshore Mine is speculative and is not reasonably foreseeable with current information. If"

Although not assessed quantitatively, DNR has considered potential future operations at the Northshore Mine against information that is available. DNR acknowledges it cannot rule out that future operations at the Northshore Mine could induce northward groundwater bedrock flow from the NorthMet Mine Site. See Final EIS Section 6.2.2.3.1. This might happen if there is insufficient natural downward leakage into bedrock from the overlying wetlands and surficial materials between the proposed NorthMet Mine (in closure) and the Northshore Mine (in future operations and closure.

The potential effects of hypothetical failure scenarios have not been assessed in this FEIS, as the risk of failure is mitigated through application of design and safety requirements including adaptive management procedures (GT 15). In addition, MDNR has the authority to require remedial action for unforeseen effects or events (FIN 12). The Nature Conservancy (represented by Maya Batres) did not request an Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) in its comment letter on the SDEIS.

The Final SDD required the groundwater flow model to predict pit inflows at various stages of pit development (i.e., year 1, year 5, year 10, year 20) and include operation, closure, and post-closure. The model satisfies this condition of the final scoping decision. GLIFWC changed the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model to include future mining activity at the NorthShore Mine Peter Mitchell Pits, which is outside the scope of the EIS. If the EIS scope were defined to assess of how future activity at the Peter Mitchell Pit might influence the closure conditions at the NorthMet site, then additional data would be required north of the Mine Site on which to refine the EIS Mine Site MODFLOW model for : 1) vertical hydraulic conductivity for wetlands and surficial deposits; 2) horizontal hydraulic conductivities in bedrock (e.g., Virginia Formation; BIF); 3) variability of hydraulic conductivities within the bedrock units, and 4) the hydrologic significance of 100 Mile Swamp in providing a source of water for downward leakage. Each of these refinements is important to quantitatively assess the likelihood and potential magnitude of a northward bedrock flowpath. Modeling would also have to reconcile uncertainty regarding the sequence and timing of future Northshore mining operations, including the depth"

To support mine planning and waste-rock handling, PolyMet developed a geologic “block model,” which is a three-dimensional grid that represents the deposit and that provides an estimate for ore grade and sulfide S concentration in each grid block. The estimates of sulfide S in NorthMet waste and ore are based on interpolation of sulfide S analyzed in recovered drill core (approximately 18,800 analyzed samples). To ensure that the estimates of sulfide S concentration in the waste rock are accurate, the Co-lead Agencies commissioned an independent review of the geostatistical analysis used to develop the sulfide S distribution in the block model. For this, the reviewer obtained the entire dataset of sulfide S analyses on core samples. This audit found that the number and spatial distribution of the sulfide analyzed supported the geologic block model, which was developed to describe the ore and waste rock distribution in the deposit (Optitech 2012)."

NEPA (as well as MEPA) recognize that EISs are planning tools that focus agency analyses on significant environmental issues (40 CFR 1501.1(d)). As a tool, an EIS analyzes proposals at an appropriate level, given that the permitting process would require more finely tuned analyses based on further understanding of environmental conditions and project design. This means that the NEPA and MEPA phase of the environmental review process requires less specificity for proposed projects, and demands additional detail for the permitting phase. Pursuant to NEPA and MEPA, mitigation measures and their effectiveness have been considered in the EIS. The actual effectiveness of any approved and implemented mitigation measures would be monitored as part of permit conditions, which may lead to additional mitigation measures being required of the permit holder."

NEPA (as well as MEPA) recognize that EISs are planning tools that focus agency analyses on significant environmental issues (40 CFR 1501.1(d)). As a tool, an EIS analyzes proposals at an appropriate level, given that the permitting process would require more finely tuned analyses based on further understanding of environmental conditions and project design. This means that the NEPA and MEPA phase of the environmental review process requires less specificity for proposed projects, and demands additional detail for the permitting phase. Pursuant to NEPA and MEPA, mitigation measures and their effectiveness have been considered in the EIS. The actual effectiveness of any approved and implemented mitigation measures would be monitored as part of permit conditions, which may lead to additional mitigation measures being required of the permit holder."

SDEIS Thematic Response ALT 01. Section 2.0 of the September 2013 Underground Mining Alternative Assessment identifies that alternative was screened against five (5) criteria, including economic feasibility and project purpose and need. DNR reviewed the Proposer's cost assessment of developing and operating an underground mine at the NorthMet deposit as defined for the project. The agency acknowledges that this assessment includes uncertainty but asserts this a reasonable approximation of potential economic feasibility for the purposes of alternatives screening. DNR notes that Section 2.4.1 of the Final SDD recognized that both the potential costs and economic return of an underground mine alternative would be considered, including whether the purpose of the project could be satisfied. This latter point is consistent with Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2300, item G, which indicated that an alternative may be excluded from analysis in an EIS if it would not meet the underlying need for or purpose of the project. DNR appropriately considered the factors identified in the Final SDD and determined the underlying need for and purpose of the project would not be satisfied employing underground mining methods."

Barr 2015f 4.3.5.1, 4.3.5.2. The Final EIS acknowledges that under certain localized conditions the introduction of sulfate to a water resource may contribute to the production of methyl mercury. However when taken as a whole, the project would result in a reduction of the loading and concentration of sulfate within the Embarrass River watershed and that this overall reduction would likely not result in adverse effects on downstream resources from mercury methylation. It is this concept that formed the basis for the MPCA strategy (MPCA 2006a) to address the indirect effects of sulfate on methyl mercury production. It is noted that sulfate that discharges directly into streams only enhances methyl mercury if it interacts extensively with organic carbon along the flow path to the stream or as it moves downstream. Empirical evidence from around the Iron Range (comparing low and high sulfate rivers - where sulfate is introduced from the sumping of pits) reveal that once in the river, sulfate interaction with organic matter is usually insufficient to impact methylmercury that comes from other background sources"

For example, additional compensatory mitigation (i.e., a higher replacement ratio) is proposed to offset loss of bog wetlands, a difficult-to-replace wetland type.

Andrew Comfort,when assessing cumulative effects minnesota rules 44100200 states preparers polymet feis must considerwhether future development indicated historic forecasted trends feis not consider certain historic forecasted trends resultant northward flow water impact boundary waters canoe area ignoring these historic trends preparers feis including forest service violation minnesota rules,CUM,S,N,2,"FEIS Sections 6.1.1.1, 6.2.2. DNR asserts that it is possible to detect and prevent any northward flowpath before any impacts are realized. Final EIS Section 5.2.2.3.6 details specific monitoring requirements, including expansion of the existing system of bedrock groundwater monitoring wells. The goal of the monitoring would be to determine future bedrock flow direction immediately north of the NorthMet pits to identify any need for engineered preventive mitigation measures. Final EIS Section 5.2.2.3.5 identifies known measures that could be applied if a potential for northward flow was detected.  The Final EIS's cumulative effects analysis and treatment of cumulative actions considered (Final EIS Section 6.1.1.2.1) and speculative actions (Final EIS Section 6.1.1.2.2) is consistent with the requirements of Minnesota Rules part 4410.0200, subpart 11a. The FEIS identifies 30 past, present, and/or reasonably foreseeable actions related to mining activity, and also identifies 10 speculative mining-related actions, all of which indicate the potential for future development by historic or forecasted trends.  Minnesota Rules, part 4410.0200, subpart 11a, defines ""cumulative potential effects"" to involve ""the incremental effects of the proposed project in addition to other projects in the environmentally relevant area that might be reasonably expected to affect the same environmental resources."" The EIS defines reasonably foreseeable as those actions that are included in approved planning documents and have approved funding, are in permitting, or have a currently active federal or state permit or site plan application under review. DNR asserts this approach is consistent with cited rule."

The analysis in the FEIS acknowledges this scientific uncertainty. Methylmercury produced in wetlands is not necessarily incorporated into food chains and concentrated to levels of concern. The potential small incremental addition of mercury to wetlands from the NorthMet Project Proposed Action is within the variability of background deposition estimates and is not expected to have any measurable effect on the mercury methylation process in wetlands in the NorthMet Project Proposed Action area. The Co- lead Agencies acknowledge that there could be water quality effects on wetlands and propose a comprehensive monitoring approach during operations, reclamation, and closure to identify such effects (if any). If effects are identified, adaptive mitigation measures would be invoked to remediate the situation and assure that water quality standards are met."

The well data also represent greater temporal coverage, including measurements from a greater number of years and seasons, than do the pond data and thus encompass a greater range of variability. The values measured in the Cell 2E pond (3 samples from 0.7 to 3.6 ng/L) fall within the range of values measured in the toe wells (72 samples from <0.5 to 153 ng/L), and both groups of samples have median (50th percentile) values of 1.0 ng/L. As described by several researchers (Helsel 2011; EPA 2009; Reimann et al. 2008), the median is often a better descriptor of environmental data sets than is a mean value because a small number of data points can skew the mean to be larger while most of the data points are less than the mean value. Therefore, although more extreme values, including several particularly high outliers, were measured in the wells, overall measurements do not suggest a difference in concentration between the Cell 2E Pond and the seepage water at the toe of the Tailings Basin. It should also be noted that the pond sampling for mercury occurred from 4 to 11 years before the toe well sampling and, depending on hydrologic properties of the tailings, may not represent the starting pond composition of the water collected in the toe wells, and the simple comparison being made is implying a relationship between the data when there may be none because of the different"

The agency acknowledges it cannot rule out that future operations at the Northshore Mine could induce northward groundwater bedrock flow from the NorthMet Mine Site. See Final EIS Section 6.2.2.3.1. This might happen if there is insufficient natural downward leakage into bedrock from the overlying wetlands and surficial materials between the proposed NorthMet Mine (in closure) and the Northshore Mine (in future operations and closure. If there is sufficient downward leakage, then there would be groundwater flow divide between the two mines where there is no continuous one-way flow between the facilities. If natural leakage is insufficient to maintain a groundwater flow divide between the two facilities, then the possibility a northward groundwater flowpath is present. DNR"

Sarah Elizabeth,why wasn’t hydraulic conductivity biwabik formation retested even though expected highest permeability,WAT,S,N,3,"Available drilling data and subsequent interpolation of geology between the drill holes does not indicate any contact between the NorthMet project and the Biwabik Iron Formation. The final phase of development would retain an approximate 130 to 150 foot separation between the proposed mine pits and the bedrock unit. Because of this, the EIS did not require collection of new data on the Biwabik Iron Formation, but relied on existing estimates of hydraulic conductivity from a reliable source, in this case Siegel and Ericson (1980). DNR's Final SDD (section 3.3.4 Water Appropriations) identified: Mine Site - The amount of water that must be discharged to dewater the mine pit is a significant issue that will be included in the EIS. The following information will be used to better estimate this amount of water: • A report on the design and effectiveness of diking and trenching to prevent surface runoff into the pit. • A wetland hydrology study. • Hydrogeology studies of the NorthMet Deposit including the potential for water to enter the pit from the Virginia Formation. • A water balance model to estimate the quantity of water entering the pit from various sources (including direct precipitation into the pit) with consideration of seasonal changes and pit size.

John Herbst,comment pilot studies ie ongoing experimental methods both unproven undocumented over long term up 500 years more used replace proven technology mechanical treatment what agencies governmental bodies will judge these new unfounded unproven over longterm nonmechanical water treatment methods nan,PER,S,N,9,"The FEIS identifies in several places (FEIS page 3-8, responses to SDEIS Theme PD 06, and others) that switching to non-mechanical treatment would have to be approved by regulatory authorities and that consideration of this would only occur if the Proposer proves it would work. The State of Minnesota would be the governmental body, through its regulatory agencies determining if or when a transition to non-mechanical treatment would be permittable. The NorthMet Project Proposed Action relies on mechanical treatment for as long as necessary. FEIS Chapter 3 states that PolyMet has committed to conducting pilot and other feasibility studies on the use of non- mechanical treatment as an adaptive management measure if proven effective and cost efficient. The possible future use of non-mechanical treatment is stated as a long-term goal, but the details of how such systems would operate would be determined once operations begin and site specific data could be used for pilot/feasibility studies, and if eventually proposed would be addresses in future permitting. The WWTF would continue to treat water until water quality monitoring demonstrates that effluent would achieve water quality standards under non- mechanical treatment. Similarly, the WWTP would continue to treat Tailings Basin seepage until non- mechanical treatment would be demonstrably"
John Herbst,2 figure 7 plant site layout northmet mining project land exchange feis there appears substantial reductions rock buttressing south end tailings basin compared north end there reason perhaps higher elevations between south end tailings basin colby lake impeding water drainage south solid bedrock impervious water flow south tailings basin preventing any drainage towards colby lake,GT,S,N,2,"The size of the buttress is driven by the Factor of Safety (FS). A large buttress is needed on the north side due the height of the proposed dam (250 feet), the existing materials the dam is built upon (peat in the base), and the thickness and characteristics of the materials of LTV dams that Polymet will be built upon. The large buttress is needed to bring the FS up to the required standards. On the north side the dam will be about 250 feet at final height while on the south side, the height will be closer to 150. The dam on the north will be built on softer peat and tailings while the dam on the south will be built on a mixture of high ground and a rock stockpile used to support the railroad. The base on the south is also much wider than the base on the north. Therefore, a smaller buttress is needed to meet the Factor of Safety requirements. PolyMet 2015n NorthMet Project Flotation Tailings Management Plan, Section 2.0 FTB Design addresses the buttresses. PolyMet 2015L NorthMet Project Geotechnical Data Package - Flotation Tailings Basin, Section 6.3.2. FTB Design and Section 6.3.2.2 Buttress Design."
